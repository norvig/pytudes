    ">Say you’re given the following challenge: create a set of five rectangles that have sides of length 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 units. You can combine sides in a variety of ways: for example, you could create a set of rectangles with dimensions 1 x 3, 2 x 4, 5 x 7, 6 x 8 and 9 x 10.\n",

Let's answer them."

    "    \n",
    "**Method 1: Count all permutations and divide by repetitions:** There are 10 variables to be filled, so there are 10! = 3,628,800 permutations.  But if we fill the first two variables with 1 &times; 3, that is the same rectangle as 3 &times; 1. So divide 10! by 2<sup>5</sup> to account for the fact that each of 5 rectangles can appear 2 ways.  Similarly, if we fill A and B with 1 &times; 3, that yields the same set as if we filled C and D with 1 &times; 3.  So divide again by 5! (the number of permutations of 5 things) to account for this.\n",

An alternate to \"count and divide\" is to count directly how many sets there are that respect this ordering.  We'll work from left to right.  How many choices are there for variable A?  Only one: A must always be 1, because we agreed that the smallest number comes first. Then, given A, there are 9 remaining choices for B.  For C, given A and B, there is again only one choice: C must be the smallest of the remaining 8 numbers (it will be 3 if the first rectangle was 1 &times; 2; otherwise it will be 2, but either way there is only one choice).  That leaves 7 choices for D, 5 for F, 3 for H and 1 for J. So:\n",

To implement method 2, the minimum side will always be the first element, A, in an (A, B) pair. We iterate through all possible values for B, and then join that pair with all possible rectangles made from the remaining sides. We also have to handle the case when there are no sides; then there is one possible set of rectangles: the empty set."

    "Now we need a strategy for packing a set of rectangles onto a grid.  I know that many variants of [bin packing problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) are NP-hard, but we only have 5 rectangles, so it should be easy: just exhaustively try each rectangle in each possible position, and in both possible orientations (horizontal and vertical). But placing rectangles is commutative, so we can do this two ways:\n",

    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "> Way 2: Considering the *positions* in a fixed order, try every possible *rectangle* for each *position*.\n",

Then we try to put the biggest rectangle in all possible positions on the grid, and for each position that fits, try putting the second biggest rectangle in all remaining positions, and so on.  As a rough estimate, assume there are on average about 10 ways to place a rectangle.  Then this way will look at about 10<sup>5</sup> = 100,000 combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Way 2, we consider the positions in some fixed order; say top-to-bottom, left-to right.  Take the first empty position (say, the upper left corner).  Try putting each of the rectangles there, and for each one that fits, try all possible rectangles in the next empty position, and so on. There are only 5! permutations of rectangles, and each rectangle can go either horizontaly or vertically, so we would have to consider 5! &times; 2<sup>5</sup> = 3840 combinations.  Since 3840 &lt; 100,000, I'll go with Way 2.  Here is a more precise description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Way 2: To `pack` a set of rectangles onto a grid, find the first empty cell on the grid.  Try in turn all possible placements of any rectangle (in either orientation) at that position. For each one that fits, try to `pack` the remaining rectangles, and return the resulting grid if one of these packings succeeds.  "

My approach was simple: try all permutations of digits replacing letters (that should be quick and easy&mdash;there can be at most 10 factorial or 3.6 million permutations), then for each one, use Python's `eval` function to see if the resulting string is a true expression.  The basic idea is simple, but there are complications to worry about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Math uses `=` and Python uses `==` for equality; we'll allow either one.\n",
    "2. The more detailed rules for these problems say that a number with a leading zero (like `012`) is illegal (but `0` itself is ok).\n",
    "3. By default, Python thinks that 3/2 is 1, because integer division rounds down.  But we can import \"proper\" division from the future.\n",
    "4. If we try to eval an expression like 1/0, Python raises an error; we'll have to handle it."
