    "[Andrew Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles) proved Fermat's theorem in 1995, but Beal's conjecture remains unproved, and Beal has offered [one million dollars](http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-supported/beal-prize) for a proof or disproof. I don't have the mathematical skills of Wiles, so I could never find a proof, but I can write a program to search for  counterexamples. I first wrote [that program in 2000](http://norvig.com/beal2000.html), and [my name got associated](https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=beal conjecture) with Beal's Conjecture, which means I get a lot of emails with purported proofs or counterexamples (many asking how they can collect their prize money). So far, all the emails have been wrong. This notebook catalogs some of the more common errors, updates my 2000 program, and introduces this tool for verifying counterexamples:\n",

A common error is to show how a certain pattern generates an infinite number of $(A, x, B, y, C, z)$ examples, and that the conjecture holds for this entire infinite collection.

In general, any time we have a composite exponent, such as $b^{qp}$, where $p$ is prime, we should ignore $A=b, x=qp$, and instead consider only $A=b^q, x=p$. There's one complication to this scheme: 2 is a prime, but 2 is not a valid exponent for a Beal counterexample.  So we will allow 4 as an exponent, as well as all odd primes up to `max_x`.\n",

For example, what if $2^7 = 5^3 = s$; then wouldn't we have to have both 2 and 5 as values for $s$ in the table?

In another sense, there is a difference. With this optimization, when we run `beal(6, 10)`, we are no longer testing $512$ as a value of $A$ or $B$, even though $512 = 2^9$ and both $2$ and $9$ are within range, because the program chooses to express $512$ as $8^3$, and $8$ is not in the specified range.

    "We don't see a speedup here, but the idea is that as we start dealing with much larger integers, this version should be faster. I could improve this version by caching certain computations, managing the memory layout better, moving some computations out of loops, considering using multiple different numbers as the modulus (as in a Bloom filter), finding a way to parallelize the program, and re-coding in a faster compiled language (such as C++ or Go or Julia). Then I could invest thousands (or millions) of CPU hours searching for counterexamples. \n",

So I don't think it is worthwhile to continue on that path.\n",

I suggest you work on a proof rather than a counterexample, or work on some other interesting problem instead!"
