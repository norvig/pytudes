    "\n",
    ">  **Ghost** *is a written or spoken word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, and usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as three or four letters. The player who completes a word loses.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to create a program to allow any two players (human or computer) to play the game, and I'd like to figure out who wins if both players play optimally. The concepts I will need to define, and my implementation choices, are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Words**: I will read a standard online word list, `enable1`, and make a set of all the words of sufficient length.\n",
    "- **Fragment**: a fragment is a `str` of letters, such as `'gho'`.\n",
    "- **Beginning**: each word has a set of valid beginnings: for `ghost` it is `{'', g, gh, gho, ghos, ghost}`.  \"Prefix\" is a synonym of \"beginning\".\n",
    "- **Vocabulary**: A `Vocabulary` object holds a set of all the `words` in a dictionary, as well as all the valid `fragments` (beginnings) of the words.\n",
    "- **Player**: The first player will be called player `0`; the second player `1`. \n",
    "- **Play**: A play is a new fragment formed by adding one letter to the end of the existing fragment.\n",
    "- **Legal Play**: A play that is a valid prefix of some word. `enable1.legal_plays('gho') = {'ghos, 'ghou'}`.\n",
    "- **Strategy**: A strategy is a function with signature `strategy(vocab, fragment) -> play`.\n",
    "- **Game**: `play_game(vocab, *strategies)` plays a game between two (or more) player strategies.\n",

Because I did that, I should be able to use all the existing code if I just make a new class, `SuperVocabulary`, that finds *all* fragments (i.e. infixes) rather than just the beginning fragments (i.e. prefixes), and if I change `legal_plays` to add letters to both ends."

    "- **Exploitation:** What are some good strategies when you are not guaranteed to win, to exploit an imperfect human opponent? Can you steer the game so that you win if the opponent is unfamiliar with some obscure word(s)? You might need a file of [word frequencies](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt).\n",
    "- **Security:** A strategy function could *cheat*, and modify  `vocab.words`, inserting or deleting some crucial words to ensure victory. Can you harden `play` (and/or change `Vocabulary`) to protect against that?\n",
    "- **Pruning:** Currently `Vocabulary` saves words and fragments that could never be reached in a game. For example, because `'the'` is a word that ends the game, we could never reach `'them'` or `'theme'` or `'thermoluminescences'`. Can you prune away these redundant words/fragments?\n",
    "- **Multi-player:** `play(enable1, ask('A'), ask('B'), ask('C'))` will play a three-player game. But `rational` (along with `win` and `winner`) would no longer work, since they assume there are exactly two players. Can you alter them to allow *n* players?\n",
    "- **SuperGhost Summary:** Can you summarize a SuperGhost or SuperDuperGhost strategy in a way that a human can memorize?\n",
    "- **Xghost:** In *Xghost*, a letter can be added anywhere, so from the fragment `'era'` you could play `'erba'`.\n",
    "- **Spook:** In *Spook*, letters can be rearranged before adding one, so from the fragment `'era'` you could play `'bear'`."
