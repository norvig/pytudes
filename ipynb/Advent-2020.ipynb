    "This year I return to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), as I did in [2016](Advent+of+Code), [17](Advent+2017), and [18](Advent-2018.ipynb). Thank you, [**Eric Wastl**](http://was.tl/)! You'll have to look at the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2020) if you want the full description of each puzzle; this notebook gives only a brief summary. \n",

    "For each day from 1 to 25, I'll write **four pieces of code**, each in a separate notebook cell. For example, on day 3:\n",
    "- `in3: List[str] = data(3)`: the day's input data, parsed into an appropriate form (here, a list of string lines). Most days the data comes from a file, read via the function `data` (which has optional arguments to say how to split the data into sections/records and how to parse each one), but some days the data is so small I just copy and paste it.\n",
    "- `def day3_1(nums): ...   `: a function that takes the day's data as input and returns the answer for Part 1.\n",
    "- `def day3_2(nums): ...   `: a function that takes the day's data as input and returns the answer for Part 2.\n",
    "- `do(3)`: executes the call `day3_1(in3)`. I'll then use the result to hopefully unlock part 2 and define `day3_2`, which also gets run when I call `do(3)` again. Once I verify both answers, I'll change `do(3)` to `do(3, 167, 736527114)` to serve as a unit test.\n",
