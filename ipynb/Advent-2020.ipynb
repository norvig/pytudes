    "# Advent of Code 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "This year I return to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), as I did in [2016](Advent+of+Code), [17](Advent+2017), and [18](Advent-2018.ipynb). Thank you, [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)! This notebook describes each day's puzzle only briefly; you'll have to look at the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2020) if you want the full details. Each puzzle has a part 1 and a part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each day from 1 to 25, I'll write **four pieces of code** with the following format (and perhaps some auxiliary code). For example, on day 3:\n",
    "- `in3: List[str] = data(3)`: the day's input data, parsed into an appropriate form (here, a list of string lines). Most days the data comes from a file, read via the function `data`, but some days the data is so small I just copy and paste it.\n",
    "- `def day3_1(nums): ...   `: a function that takes the day's data as input and returns the answer for part 1.\n",
    "- `def day3_2(nums): ...   `: a function that takes the day's data as input and returns the answer for part 2.\n",
    "- `do(3)`: runs `day3_1(in3)`. I'll then use the result to hopefully unlock part 2 and define `day3_2`, which also gets run when I call `do(3)` again. Once I verify both answers, I'll change `do(3)` to `do(3, 167, 736527114)` to serve as a unit test.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Day 0: Imports and Utility Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparations prior to Day 1:\n",
    "- Some imports.\n",
    "- A way to read the day's data file and to print/check the output.\n",
    "- Some utilities that are likely to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm not even attempting to compete for speed, I'll take the time to use reasonable variable names (not single-letter names), and to give type annotations for most of the functions I define (but not the `day` functions, which all return `int`). Traditionally, a lot of problems are of the form \"How many of your input items have property P?\", for which I can do `quantify(inputs, P)` or \"What is the sum of the result of applying F to each input item?\", for which I can do `sum(map(F, inputs))`.\n",
