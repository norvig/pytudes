    "# Winning Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "Years ago when I did a [notebook to solve **Jotto**](Jotto.ipynb), I never expected that a similar word game, [**Wordle**](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), would become so popular. Congratulations to [Josh Wardle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle) for making this happen. I added Wordle to my old [Jotto notebook](Jotto.ipynb#Wordle), and in this notebook, I answer three additional questions about Wordle. "

    "# (1) If I win in two guesses, am I good or lucky?\n",
    "\n",
    "I see people brag that they won Wordle in two guesses. Does this really attest to their acumen? Or is it analagous to [Little Jack Horner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Jack_Horner), who pulled out a plum and said *What a good boy am I!*, oblivious to the fact that his prosperity had more to do with the plethora of plums than with his prowess. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is your chance of winning on your second guess? It depends on your first guess, the reply you get from the first guess, and on how many other possible words have the same reply. For example, if your guess is `HELLO`, and the reply is `.GGGG` (a miss followed by 4 green squares), then the only possible target word is `CELLO` (note that `JELLO`™ is a proper noun, and thus is not in the word list). Less obviously, if the reply to `HELLO` is `.YGY.` (a miss, a yellow E, a green L, another yellow L, and another miss), then the only possible target word is `ALLEY`. So in either case, you are guaranteed to win on your second guess, because there is only one possible word remaining (assuming you can recognize the sole possible word). On the other hand, if the reply is `.....` (all misses), then there are 406 possible target words, and the chance of guessing right on the second guess is very low. Below we work out all the details and find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: mostly lucky.** The first guess `BRUTE` has the most guaranteed two-guess wins: 40 out of the 2,309 words in the [word list](wordle-small.txt) (about 2%). The first guess `FILET` gives the most expected wins, 56.7, assuming you have average luck in guessing with the second guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (2) What is a guaranteed-winning strategy that I can easily memorize?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Christos Papadimitriou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou) had the idea of using a radically simple strategy that takes very little thought or memorization: always choose the same first 4 guesses (regardless of the replies), and with the last two guesses, guess *any* word that is consistent with the replies so far.  Christos came up with 4 words that win 99% of the time. I was able to refine that and find 4 guesses that *always* lead to a win (assuming you can recognize the consistent guesses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: Guess the four word set `{HANDY SWIFT GLOVE CRUMP}` first; then guess *any* word consistent with the replies.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The four-preset-words strategy described above is guaranteed to win in 6 or fewer guesses, but it averages about 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (3) What is a strategy that minimizes the number of guesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm not satisfied to win in 5 or 6 guesses, what strategies  can I use (especially simple ones)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers**:\n",
    "- Following the [optimal game tree](https://www.poirrier.ca/notes/wordle-optimal/) wins **100%** of the time with an average of **3.4** guesses; but that's not simple (see [visualizations](https://laurentlessard.com/solving-wordle/)).\n",
    "- As shown in my [other notebook](Jotto.ipynb), building a game tree greedily rather than optimally takes only seconds rather than hours of compute time, and wins **100%** with an average of **3.4** guesses. But it is still not a simple strategy.\n",
    "- Guessing the three-word set `{BLIND SHAME CRYPT}` first wins **99.8%** of the time with  **4.2** average guesses.\n",
    "- Guessing the two-word set `{RETCH SNAIL}` first wins **99.4%** with  **3.8** average guesses.\n",
    "- Guessing the one-word set `{RAISE}` first wins **98%** with  **3.9** average guesses.\n",
    "- Guessing any consistent word at any time wins **98%**  with  **4.0** average guesses.\n",

The strategy would be much harder if we had to rack our brains to think of *all* the possible consistent words on the fifth and sixth guesses; it is critical to the simplicity of the strategy that as soon as you think of one consistent word you can guess it and always be guaranteed to win.
