    "# Winning Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "Years ago when I did a [notebook to solve Jotto](Jotto.ipynb), I never expected that a similar word game, [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), would become so popular. Congratulations to Josh Wardle for making this happen. I [added Wordle](Jotto.ipynb#Wordle) to my old notebook, but in this notebook, I answer two questions about Wordle (based on the pre-NYTimes version, with its [word list](wordle-small.txt) of 2,315 possible words).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# (1) If I win in two guesses, am I good or lucky?\n",
    "\n",
    "I see people brag that they won in two guesses. Does this really attest to their acumen? Or is it analagous to [Little Jack Horner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Jack_Horner), who pulled out a plum and said *What a good boy am I!*, oblivious to the fact that his prosperity had more to do with the plethora of plums than with his prowess. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is your chance of winning on your second guess? It depends on the reply you get from the first guess, and on how many other possible words have the same reply. For example, if your guess is `HELLO`, and the reply is `.GGGG` (a miss followed by 4 green squares), then the only possible target word is `CELLO`. Less obviously, if the reply to `HELLO` is `.YGY.` (a miss, a yellow, a green, another yellow, and another miss), then the only possible target word is `ALLEY`. So in either case, you are guaranteed to win on your second guess (assuming you can recognize the sole possible word). On the other hand, if the reply is `..GY.` then the target word might be either `ALLAY` or `LILAC`, so you'd have a 50% chance of winning on the second guess. So we  have two questions:\n",
    "- Q: What first guess maximizes the number of **guaranteed wins** on the second guess?\n",
    "<br>A: `BRUTE` and `CHANT` guarantee you 40 wins (out of 2,315).\n",
    "- Q: What first guess maximizes the number of **expected wins** on the second guess?\n",
    "<br>A: `TRACE` gives you 150 expected wins  (out of 2,315). \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of winning in two guesses is about 6.48%, so  the answer is: mostly lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (2) What is a winning strategy I can memorize?\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been some nice work on defining the [optimal Wordle strategy](https://www.poirrier.ca/notes/wordle-optimal/) for various ways of posing the problem. But the strategies are all complex tree structures with thousands of branch points; not the kind of thing that can be memorized by a typical human. [Christos Papadimitriou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou) had the idea of using aradically simple strategy: always choose the same first 4 guesses (regardless of the replies), and with the last two guesses, guess any word that is consistent with the replies so far. \n",
    "- Q: What simple strategy **guarantees a win** within 6 guesses?\n",
    "<br>A: Guess the four words `HANDY`, `SWIFT`, `GLOVE`, `CRUMP` first.<br>For guesses 5 and 6, guess any word consistent with the replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you follow this strategy, then out of 2,315 possible target words, there are:\n",
    "- 4 chances that you will win on one of the first four guesses\n",
    "- 2,147 chances that there will be only one consistent word left, which you will guess on the 5th guess. \n",
    "- 158 chances that there will be two consistent words left; so you'll win on either the 5th or 6th guess.\n",
    "- 6 chances that there are three consistent words left, but you can guess any one and if it is wrong, the reply will tell you which of the other two to guess on the 6th guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this strategy you will always win, with an average of a little over 5 guesses. That's worse than the complex strategies that are guaranteed to win in 5 guesses and have an average of around 3.5 or 3.4, but you only need to remember four words to use this strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basics, including the word list, `words`, and the `reply_for` function."
