    "# Docstring Fixpoint Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes a proposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One approach to writing a short function (in Python or other programming langauges) is to repeatedly alternate editing the **docstring** and the  **body** of the function until they converge to a **[fixpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point)** in which there is an obvious one-to-one correspondance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach follows the first of [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare)'s two methods: *\"There are two methods in software design. One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors.\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "Some caveats: \n",
    "- This approach is not always appropriate! For many functions the docstring is a high-level description and the code has more detail that is not in the docstring. Docstring fixpoint theory makes the most sense  for very short functions.\n",
    "- The edits will change the wording, but must maintain the meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs are easier to understand with [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), and dataclasses are nice, so I'll start with this:"
