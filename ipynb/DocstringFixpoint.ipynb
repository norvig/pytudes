    "# Docstring Fixpoint Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes the following proposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One approach to writing the code for a function is to repeatedly edit the **docstring** and the function **code** until they converge to a **fixpoint** in which there is an obvious one-to-one correspondance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach follows the first of [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare)'s two methods: *\"There are two methods in software design. One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors.\"* Some caveats: \n",
    "- This approach is not always appropriate! For many functions the docstring is a high-level description and the code has more detail that is not in the docstring.\n",
    "- The edits to the docstring must maintain the meaning (just change the expression).\n",
