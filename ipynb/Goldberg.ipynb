    "[RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), [LSTMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) and [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) are all the rage, and a recent [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy is doing a great job explaining what these models are and how to train them.\n",
    "It also provides some very impressive results of what they are capable of.  This is a great post, and if you are interested in natural language, machine learning or neural networks you should definitely read it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Go [**read it now**](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), then come back here. \n",
    "\n",
    "You're back? Good. Impressive stuff, huh? How could the network learn to imitate the input like that?\n",
    "Indeed. I was quite impressed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it feels to me that most readers of the post are impressed by the wrong reasons.\n",
    "This is because they are not familiar with **unsmoothed maximum-liklihood character level language models** and their unreasonable effectiveness at generating rather convincing natural language outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows I will briefly describe these character-level maximum-likelihood langauge models, which are much less magical than RNNs and LSTMs, and show that they too can produce a rather convincing Shakespearean prose. I will also show about 30 lines of python code that take care of both training the model and generating the output. Compared to this baseline, the RNNs may seem somehwat less impressive. So why was I impressed? I will explain this too, below."

    "## Unsmoothed Maximum Likelihood Character Level Language Model \n",
    "\n",
    "The name is quite long, but the idea is very simple.  We want a model whose job is to guess the next character based on the previous *n* characters. For example, having seen `ello`, the next characer is likely to be either a commma or space (if we assume is is the end of the word \"hello\"), or the letter `w` if we believe we are in the middle of the word \"mellow\" or \"yellow\". Humans are quite good at this, but of course seeing a larger history makes things easier (if we were to see 5 letters instead of 4, the choice between space and `w` would have been much easier).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call *n*, the number of letters we need to guess based on, the _order_ of the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs and LSTMs can potentially learn infinite-order language model (they guess the next character based on a \"state\" which supposedly encodes all the previous history). We here will restrict ourselves to a fixed-order language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are seeing *n* letters, and need to guess the *n+1*th one. We are also given a large-ish amount of text (say, all of Shakespeare's works) that we can use. How would we go about solving this task?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we would like to learn a function *P(c* | *h)*. Here, *c* is a character, *h* is a *n*-character history, and *P(c* | *h)* stands for how likely is it to see *c* after we've seen *h*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest approach would be to just count and divide (a.k.a **maximum likelihood estimates**). We will count the number of times each letter *c* appeared after *h*, and divide by the total numbers of letters appearing after *h*. The **unsmoothed** part means that if we did not see a given letter following *h*, we will just give it a probability of zero.\n",

We could get more variety in the generated text by breaking the training text up into sections  and inserting padding at the start of each section. But that would require some knowledge of the structure of the training text; right know the only assumption is that it is a sequence of characters."
