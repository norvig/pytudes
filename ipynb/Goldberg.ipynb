    "# The Effectiveness of Generative Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an expansion of [**Yoav Goldberg's 2015 notebook**](https://nbviewer.org/gist/yoavg/d76121dfde2618422139) on character-level *n*-gram language models, which in turn was a response to  [**Andrej Karpathy's 2015 blog post**](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on recurrent neural network (RNN) language models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term [**generative AI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligencehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) is all the rage these days; it refers to computer programs that can *generate* something new (such as an image or a piece of text). \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015 Karpathy's point was that recurrent neural networks were unreasonably effective at generating good text, even though they are at heart rather simple. Goldberg's point was that, yes, they are effective, but actually most of the magic is not in the RNNs, it is  in the training data itself, and an even simpler model (with no neural nets) does just as well at generating English text. Goldberg and Karpathy agree that the RNN captures some aspects of C++ code that the simpler model does not. My point is to update the decade-old Python code, and make a few enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **generative language model** is a model that, when given an initial text, can predict what tokens come next; it can generate a continuation of a partial text. (And when the initial text is empty, it can generate the whole text.) In terms of probabilities, the model represents *P*(*t* | *h*), the probability distribution that the next token will be *t*, given a history of previous tokens *h*. The probability distribution is estimated by looking at a training corpus of text.\n",
    "- A **token** is a unit of text. In a character model, \"walking\" would be 7 tokens, one for each letter, while in a word model it would be one token, and in other models it might be two tokens (\"walk\", \"ing\").\n",
    "- A generative model stands in contrast to a **discriminative model**, such as an email spam filter, which can discriminate between spam and non-spam, but can't be used to generate a new sample of spam.\n",
    "- An **n-gram model** is a generative model that estimates the probability of *n*-token sequences. For example, a 5-gram character model would be able to say that given the previous 4 characters `'chai'`, the next character might be `'r'` or `'n'` (to form `'chair'` or `'chain'`). A 5-gram model is also called a [Markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model) of **order** 4, because it maps from the 4 previous tokens to the next token.\n",
    "- A **recurrent neural network (RNN) model** is more powerful than an *n*-gram model, because it contains memory units that allow it to retain some information from more than *n* tokens in the past. See Karpathy for [details](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).\n",
    "- Current **large language models** such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini use a more powerful model called a [transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_%28deep_learning_architecture%29).  Karpathy has [an introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g&t=159s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A language model learns probabilities by counting token subsequences in a corpus of text that we call the **training data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both Karpathy and Goldberg use the works of Shakespeare as their initial training data:"

    "Shakespeare never wrote about \"chaise longues,\" or \"chai tea\" so the probability of an \"s\" or space following \"chai\" is zero, according to our language model. But do we really want to say it is absolutely impossible for the sequence of letters \"chais\" or \"chai \" to appear anywhere in a text, just because we didn't happen to see it in our training data? More sophisticated language models use [**smoothing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneser%E2%80%93Ney_smoothing) to assign non-zero (but small) probabilities to previously-unseen sequences. A simple type of smoothing is  \"add-one smoothing\"; it assumes that if we have counted *N* tokens following a given history, then the probability of an unseen token is 1 / (*N* + 1), and the probabilities for the previously-seen tokens are reduced accordingly (dividing by *N* + 1 instead of *N*):"

    "One thing you may have noticed: all the generated passages start the word \"First\". Why is that? Because the training data happens to start with the line \"First Citizen:\", and so when we call `generate_tokens`, we start with an empty history, and the only thing that follows the empty history in the training data is the letter \"F\", the only thing that follows \"F\" is \"i\", and so on, until we get to a point where there are multiple choices. We could get more variety in the start of the generated text by breaking the training text up into multiple sections, so that each section would contribute a different possible starting point. But that would require some knowledge of the structure of the training text; right now the only assumption is that it is a sequence of tokens/characters.\n",

    "We can give a starting text to `generate_tokens` and it will continue from there. But since the models only look at a few characters of history (just 4 for `LM`), this won't make much difference. For example, the following won't make the model generate a story about Romeo:"

    "As Goldberg says, \"Order 10 is pretty much junk.\" But order 20 is much better. Most of the comments have a start and an end; most of the open parentheses are balanced with a close parentheses; but the braces are not as well balanced. That shouldn't be surprising. If the span of an open/close parenthesis pair is less than 20 characters then it can be represented within the model, but if the span of an open/close brace is more than 20 characters, then it cannot be represented by the model. Goldberg notes that Karpathy's RRN seems to have learned to devote some of its long short-term memory (LSTM) to representing nesting level, as well as things like whether we are currently within a string or a comment. It is indeed impressive, as Karpathy says, that the model learned to do this on its own, without any input from the human engineer.\n",

    "## Character Models versus Word and Token Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Karpathy and Goldberg both used character models, because the exact formatting of characters (especially indentation and line breaks) is important in the format of plays and C++ programs. But if you are interested in generating paragraphs of text that don't have any specific format, it is  common to use a **word** model, which represents the probability of the next word given the previous words, or a **token** model in which tokens can be words, punctuation, or parts of words. For example, the text `\"Spiderman!\"` might be broken up into the three tokens `\"Spider\"`, `\"man\"`, and `\"!\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way of tokenizing a text is to break it up into alternating strings of word and non-word characters; the function `tokenize` does that:"
