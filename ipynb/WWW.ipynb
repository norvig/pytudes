    "The Golden State Warriors have had a historic basketball season, winning more games than any other team ever has. But will they top that off by winning the championship? There are 15 other teams in contention, including one, the Spurs, that has had a historic season as the best second-best team ever. The web site fivethirtyeight, using a complicated scoring system, [gives](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-nba-picks/) the Warriors a 44% chance of winning, with the Spurs at 28%. Basketball-reference [has](http://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/playoff_prob.cgi) the Warriors at 41% and Spurs at 32.5%, while a [betting site](http://www.oddsshark.com/nba/nba-futures) had the Warriors at 54% and Spurs at 18%. But what's a good way to make a prediction? There are several choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subjective impression of a team's strength? Or a statistical model?\n",
    "- Predictions based on:\n",
    "  - Holistic impression of entire postseason (e.g. \"I think the Warriors have a 50% chance of winning it all\")\n",
    "  - Series by series (e.g. \"I think the Warriors have a 95% chance of beating the Rockets in the first round, then ...\")\n",
    "  - Game by game (e.g. \"I think the Warriors have a 83% chance of beating the Rockets in Game 1, then ...\")\n",
    "  - Possession by possession (e.g. simulate games basket by basket, based on past stats)\n",
