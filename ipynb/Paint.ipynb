    "Zach Wissner-Gross's *Fiddler on the Proof!* column [poses a question](https://thefiddler.substack.com/p/can-you-paint-by-number) that I will restate as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a two-dimensional grid of squares, where each square is colored either red or blue. A **cluster** is a group of contiguous squares of the same color (contiguity must be horizontal or vertical, not diagonal). For example, in the following 10 × 2 grid there are four red clusters and five blue clusters:\n",

    "\n",
    "Altogether there are 20 squares and 9 clusters, so the average cluster size is 20/9 ≈ 2.22 squares. Under the assumption that every square is equally likely to be red or blue, Zach poses two questions (and I'll add three more):\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the average cluster size for a grid consisting of a single infinitely long row?\n",
    "- What is the average cluster size for a grid consisting of two infinitely long rows?\n",
    "- What is the average cluster size for a grid of any given size *w* × *h*?\n",
    "- What if there are three or more colors rather than just two?\n",
    "- If you pick a random square, what is the average size of its cluster?\n",

    "# Code to Make Grids and to Count Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "I can see three approaches to answering these questions:\n",
    "1) Enumerate all possible grids  up to a certain size, compute the average cluster size for each grid, and average the averages. This gives an exact answer for grids of a specific size, but it can't say anything about infinite size grids. In fact it starts getting slow for grids with more than about 20 squares, because there are 2<sup>*n*</sup> grids with *n* squares. \n",
    "2) Randomly select some grids and average cluster sizes over them. This can handle grids with thousands of squares, but the averages will be only estimates.\n",
    "3) Come up with a mathematical proof that proves the answer for grids of any width *w*.\n",
    "\n",

    "I can easily write code to implement the first two approaches. I'll start with some imports and the definition of three data types:"

Fortunately, Zach [provides the answer](https://thefiddler.substack.com/p/can-you-eclipse-via-ellipse) by breaking down the possibilities into cases. With the single-row grid, we only needed two cases: column *k* introduced a new cluster 1/2 the time. But with two rows there are 16 cases: each of the two squares in column *k* and the two in column *k* - 1 can be either red or blue. Overall, as aach's diagram below shows, there are 10 new clusters introduced in 16 cases, so the number of new clusters per column is 10/16, and the average cluster size over *W* columns is 2*W* / ((10/16)·*W*) = 16/5 = 3.2.\n",

    "The mathematical analysis here is much trickier. With two rows, we can tell how many new clusters are introduced in column *k* just by looking at column *k* - 1. But with three or more rows, that's no longer true. Suppose the top and bottom squares in a column are red. Is that one red cluster or two? We have to look a potentially *unbounded* number of columns away to see if they are connected (by a column that has red in all three squares). So no local analysis can determine the number of new clusters per column; we'll need some new method of analysis. \n",

It is because the two numbers are answering two different questions. **7.5** is the answer to \"if we randomly pick a **cluster**, what is its expected size\"? **60** is the answer to \"if we randomly pick a **square**, what is the expected size of the square's cluster?\"\n",
