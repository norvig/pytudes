    "\n",
    "Here are the key concepts and the Python implementation choices I made:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Digit**: the digits are the characters `'1'` to `'9'`. \n",
    "- **Digit set**: when several digits could fill a square, use `'123'` to mean  1, 2, or 3 are possible.\n",
    "- **Rows**: by convention the 9 rows have labels `'A'` to `'I'` (top to bottom). \n",
    "- **Columns**: by convention the 9 columns have labels `'1'` to `'9'` (left to right).\n",
    "- **Boxes**: the 9 boxes are 3×3 squares within the grid (outlined with heavy black lines in the diagram). \n",
    "- **Square**: a square is named by the concatenation of its row and column labels, e.g. `'A9'` is the upper-rightmost square.\n",
    "  - `squares` is a tuple of all 81 squares.\n",
    "- **Grid**: a grid of 81 squares is represented as a dict of `{Square: DigitSet}` such as `{'A9': '123', ...}`.\n",
    "  - `Fail` represents a grid that has no solution (e.g. if we guess wrong on the filler for some square).\n",
    "- **Picture**: for input and output, a string *picture* of the grid is used (details described below).\n",
    "- **Unit**: a unit is a row, column, or box; each unit is a list of 9 squares. \n",
    "  - `all_units` is a tuple of all 27 units.\n",
    "  - `units[s]` is a tuple of the 3 units that square `s` is a part of.\n",
    "- **Peers**: the squares that share a unit are called peers. \n",
    "  - `peers[s]` is a set of 20 squares that are in some unit with `s`.\n",
    "- **Solution**: A grid is a valid solution to a puzzle if:\n",
    "  - A square that was filled with a digit in the puzzle has the same digit in the solution.\n",
    "  - Every unit is filled with all nine digits, one to a square, no repeats."

    "  - `int` bitset: each digit is represented by a bit; a DigitSet is a 9-bit binary int.\n",
    "    - Efficient, but obfuscating. Used in the [Java version](SudokuJava.ipynb) for efficiency.\n",

    "    - But the first round of constraint propagation touches almost all the squares anyway.\n",
    "  - `list` of 9 rows, each a `list` of 9 squares (or a numpy 2D array):\n",
    "    - Then a `Square` is a pair of coordinates, like `(1, 2)` rather than the simpler string `C2`.\n",
    "    - Copying a grid would again require a `deepcopy`. \n",
    "  - `list` of 81 squares: \n",
    "    - Then a `Square` is an integer from 0 to 81.\n",

But the code is simpler if we think of `eliminate` as the fundamental operation, and implement `fill` as  \"eliminate all the digits except for `d` from `s`.\" Both functions mutate the grid they are passed, and return the mutated grid if they can perform the operation, or return `Fail` if there is a contradiction.\n",

If according to strategy 1 we call `eliminate(grid1, 'E5', d)` for each of these digits, then we're left with only one possible digit, `5`, for `E5`. Thus, we would next call `eliminate(grid1, s2, '5')` for each peer `s2` of 'E5'. This would lead to the square three columns to the left, `E2`, only having one remaining possible digit, `2`.
