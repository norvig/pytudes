We will say that a person **knows** the birthdate when they get down to a belief state with exactly one possibility. The type 2 uncertainty is that we don't know that Albert was told \"May\", so we have uncertainty about his belief state. But we do know some statements about his belief state, and our task is to use those statements to solve the puzzle. \n",

    "- From that we could figure out if the statements are true (given this date). \n",
