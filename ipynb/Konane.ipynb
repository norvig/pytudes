    "# Mel's Konane Board\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend and former NASA colleague [Mel Montemerlo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mel-montemerlo-a2040b205/) made this beautiful Konane set for me:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Wooden Konane Board](konane.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have the woodworking skills to make anything nearly as nice as that, so instead I thought I'd use my coding skills to make a nice program to solve the game. It's the least I can do to return the favor to Mel. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Konane Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Konane (or Kōnane) is a two-player board game from Hawaii.  To set up the game, fill each space with a marble, alternating between black and white marbles in a checkerboard pattern.  To complete the set-up, remove two adjacent marbles (one black, one white) from the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there on, the players take turns, with black moving first. A move consists of jumping a marble of your color over an adjacent opponent marble, removing that marble, and landing on the empty space beyond it.  If there is another opponent marble followed by another empty space in the same direction, the player may optionally make a double (or more) jump. Jumps may not be diagonal, and a multiple jump may not change directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When one player is unable to jump, that player loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some rules say the removed marbles must be either in a corner or in the very center; others say the two can be anywhere on the board. If you accept that they must be in a corner or the center, then there are only two distinct starting positions; the others ten are equivalent under rotation and reflection.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach to Solving  Konane\n",
    "\n",
    "A game is said to be **solved** if, for any state of the game that occurs during play, you can instantly say whether the player to move can force a win from that state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to consider is whether a 6 by 6 board is small enough that we can solve the game by exhaustive search of the graph of possible states of the game. By **state** I mean an indication of everything that matters: whose turn it is to play, and what marbles are in what spaces. The player to move is either black or white, and each of the 36 spaces can either hold a marble or not, so an upper bound is  2<sup>37</sup> ≈ 137 billion game states. However, the rules for jumping constrain the possible states of the game; most of those theoretical states are unreachable from the start state.  As a wild guess, I estimate that maybe 100 million to a billion states are rechable. That's few enough that I should be able to solve the game with exhaustive search. I'm lucky that Mel chose 6 by 6; even a 7 by 7 board would be far too large for exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will define a function `winner(state)` that will return the player who can force a win from that state, regardless of what the other player does. (There must be one such player, because ties are not allowed and there is no randomness.) Once I have cached the values of `winner`,  the optimal strategy is easy: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Play a move that leads to a game state where you are the winner.\n",
    "- If there is no such move, then you're doomed (against an optimal player); play anything."

    "# Implementation of Basic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of states for the 6 by 6 board puts us right on the edge: small enough that I'm confident I can get the program to work; big enough to require some judicious implementation choices to save time and space. For example, a straightforward way to implement a game state would be a structure with two fields, player and board, where the board is a 6 by 6 array where each element is either black, white, or empty. But a billion of those structures would consume a lot of memory. A more efficient encoding is to represent the board as a bit string: a binary integer where bit *s* is a 1 if there is a marble in space *s*, according to the following numbering scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     0  1  2  3  4  5\n",
    "     6  7  8  9 10 11\n",
    "    12 13 14 15 16 17\n",
    "    18 19 20 21 22 23\n",
    "    24 25 26 27 28 29\n",
    "    30 31 32 33 34 35\n",
    "    \n",
    "The bit representation for a board doesn't have to say whether a marble is black or white; black marbles can only be in spaces numbered 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, ... (spaces where the x coordinates plus y coordinate is even) and white only in spaces 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, ... (spaces where the x coordinate plus y coordinate is odd).\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation of a state can also be a single `int`, with the low-order bit being 1 for black, 0 for white, and the other bits being a board shifted left a bit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Given this, the implementation choices are as follows:\n",
    "- **N**: the size of the board: a global variable, defined as 6.\n",
    "- **Board**: a bit string (`int`) indicating which spaces hold marbles.\n",
    "  - The function `get(board space)` returns the player on that space, or `empty`.\n",
    "  - The function `remove(board, spaces)` returns a new board with the marbles on `spaces` removed.\n",
    "- **State**: a bit string (`int`) indicating both the board and the player whose turn it is.\n",
    "  - The function `start_state(removed)` returns a state with a full board except for `removed` spaces.\n",
    "  - The functions `encode_state` and `decode_state` join and split a board/player pair.\n",
    "- **Space**: an integer from 0 to 35 (or in general, 0 to N<sup>2</sup> - 1). \n",
    "  - The function `space(x, y)` returns an integer representing the space with given `x` and `y` coordinates. \n",
    "  - The functions `x_(space)` and `y_(space)` invert that.\n",
    "- **Player**: a one-character string, `'*'` for black and `'o'` for white.\n",
    "  - The function `other(player)` gives the opponent player.\n",
    "- **Direction**: a direction of movement is an integer giving the difference between adjacent spaces.\n",
    "  - This is +1 for right; -1 for left; -6 for up (or in general, -N); +6 for down (or in general, +N).\n",
    "  - The function `go(space, direction, k)` gives the space that is `k` steps in `direction` from `space`.\n",

In that direction there can be a single jump, a double jump, etc.; as long as the jump doesn't go off the edge of the board. The jumps are processed in that order, so when we get to, say, a triple jump, we know that the single- and double-jumps were legal; that makes checking each jump for legality easier. The function `potential_moves` doesn't consider what marbles are on the board; the function `legal_moves` does. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Make it prettier**: Use graphics for the output, e.g. ⚪️ and ⚫️ instead of 'o' and '*'.\n",
    "- **Make it interactive**: allow players to click on the board to make moves and set up positions. An interactive web page would be great, but loading 145 million positions into it would take a while. But you could trim that down: the 145 million states include the exploration of multiple paths for the optimal player, until a winning path is found. You could eliminate all branches of the tree except for one winning choice at each choice point for the optimal player (and all responses for the opponent).\n",
    "- **Use a faster language**: Statically-typed languages like Java or C++ or Go can typically execute faster than Python. Of particular interest for this program, in Python 3 the `int` returned by `start_state()` uses 32 bytes of memory. There is overhead to store the reference count, the type of the object, etc. Other languages can represent a state in just 8 bytes, as a 64-bit integer.\n",
    "- **Use concurrency**: Python is not a convenient language for taking advantage of multiple CPUs, so I didn't try to parallelize the search. But you could.\n",
    "- **Find heuristics for good but non-optimal play**: No matter how clever we get, there will be some value of **N** beyond which solving the game is impractical. But we could still achieve good play by doing alpha-beta search to a certain cut-off level and using an evaluation function to rank the resulting game states.  The evaluation function could be hand-crafted from features or learned with machine learning. Alternatively, Monte Carlo tree search could be used; this does not require an evaluation function.\n",
    "- **Explore the computational complexity**: My friend Bob Hearn has a nice [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Amazons%2C-Konane%2C-and-Cross-Purposes-are-Hearn/89f291d89c09de98a14bb265e996cd008ddd4e92) proving that Konane is PSPACE-complete. What else can be said?\n",
    "- **Apply combinatorial game theory**: A [paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/Sprouts.htm) by several authors including my friend Danny Sleator shows how to use combinatorial game theory to break a game state into components that can be analyzed separately and then combined. Using these techniques allowed them to solve the game of Sprouts for much larger sizes than had been done before; I suspect the same approach would work for Konane. Whether combinatorial game theory would work for Konane or not, it is a fascinating piece of mathematics to know about. As Bob Hearn said in [a review](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/cgt/asn/hearn-WW.pdf) of the classic [Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays](https://www.amazon.com/Elwyn-R-Berlekamp/e/B001HQ1K5A/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1), \"The theory hinges on an amazing discovery of [John] Conway. In a nutshell, the natural unification of Cantor’s construction of the ordinals with Dedekind’s construction of the reals yields, in one stroke, not only the fabulous number system that Donald Knuth dubbed the surreal numbers, but also a natural framework for combinatorial games. It’s as if the the mathematics we all know, that underpins all of science, were suddenly revealed to be a just special case of games: the universe is telling us that ultimately, it’s all about play.\""
