    "# Palindromic Panama Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "I [previously](http://norvig.com/palindrome.html) wrote a program to find long palindromic sentences. Starting with the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\n",
    "    \n",
    "the program added words to the middle, one comma-separated phrase at a time, backtracking when a choice didn't work out. The program is able to find palindromes of over 15,000 words that look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A man, a plan, a caddy, Ore, Lee, ..., Steele, Roydd, a canal, Panama.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I revisit the problem, but this time progressing one *letter* at a time rather than one phrase. That should allow me, at each choice point, to pick the letter that is most likely to lead to a complete phrase,\n",
    "perhaps leading to longer palindromes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phrase Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will build a dictionary of phrases. I start with a file, [npdict.txt](npdict.txt), which lists noun phrases &mdash;proper nouns like `'Panama'`, plural nouns like `'dogs'`, and two-word noun phrases like `'a plan'`. Capitalization, whitespace and punctuation don't count in palindromes, just letters, so I use the function `letters` to extract just the letters of each phrase and create a dict of entries like  `{'donaldeknuth': 'Donald E. Knuth'}`. In addition, to decide what letter to choose next, I will want to know if a given sequence of letters forms a *prefix* or *suffix* of other words. For example, if I have formed the partial phrase `'am'`, then adding `'a'` gives us `'ama'`, which is a prefix of over 1000 phrases in the dictionary, but adding `'d'` gives us `'amd'`, which is not a prefix of any phrase, and thus can be rejected.\n",

    "The `search` method would be more straightforward if we could write it is a recursive function. But Python does not perform well when recursing to 100 thousand levels deep. So instead I manually manage a *stack* of *commands* that tell the search what to do and to undo. A command can be a `DoCommand`, which consists of a list of letters describing all the possible actions we could take at this point. Actions include letters that could be added (only the letters that make a legitimate prefix of a known phrase in `.L` and a legitimate suffix of a known phrase in `.R`). Actions can also include the character `','`, which is used to dignal that `.L` is a complete word and should be moved ontot he `.left` list, or `';'` to signal the same for `.R/.right`. A command can also be a `UndoCommand`, which consists of a single character; one that was previously chosen to be done. So the list of characters in a `DoCommand` constitutes a choice point; we first choose one, and continue deeper from there, but we put on the command stack an `UndoCommand` to reverse the effects of the action, and put back the remaining characters to try instead, if the first character doesn't work out. Note that we pop characters off the end of a `DoCommand`, so the last character is the first one tried.\n",
