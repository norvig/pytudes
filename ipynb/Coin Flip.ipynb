    "# The Devil and the Coin Flip Game\n",
    "\n",
    ">You're playing a game with the devil, with your soul at stake. You're sitting at a circular table which has 4 coins, arranged in a diamond, at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. You are blindfolded, and can never see the coins or the table.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Your goal is to get all 4 coins showing heads, by telling the devil the position(s) of some coins to flip. We call this a \"move\" on your part. The devil must faithfully perform the requested flips, but may first sneakily rotate the table any number of quarter-turns, so that the coins are in different positions. You keep making moves, and the devil keeps rotating and flipping, until all 4 coins show heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: You tell the devil the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions. The devil could leave the table unrotated (or could rotate it a half-turn), and then flip the two coins that you specified. Or the devil could rotate the table a quarter turn in either direction, and then flip the coins that are now in the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions (which were formerly at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock).  You won't know which of these actions the devil took.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is a shortest sequence of moves that is *guaranteed* to win, no matter what the initial state of the coins, and no matter what rotations the devil applies?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The player, being blindfolded, does not know the true state of the coins. So the player should represent what is known: the *set of possible states* of the coins. We call this a *belief state*. At the start of the game, each of the four coins could be either heads or tails, so that's 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 possibilities in the belief state. \n",
    "\n",
    "A move updates the belief state as follows: for every coin sequence in the current belief state, rotate it in every possible way, and then flip the coins specified by the position(s) in the move. Collect all these results together to form the new belief state. Solving the game means coming up with a sequence of moves that ends in a belief state consisting of just `{'HHHH'}`. It must be a shortest possible sequence, so a breadth-first search seems right. The search space will be tiny, so compute time will be trivial; the only issue is specifying the domain correctly. To increase the chance of getting it correct, I won't try to do anything fancy, such as noticing that some coin sequences are rotational variants of other sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main concepts, and my implementation choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Coins`: A *coin sequence* is represented as a `str` of four characters, such as `'HTTT'`. \n",
    "- `Belief`: A *belief state* is represented as a `frozenset` of `Coins` (frozen so that it can be hashed in a `set`).\n",
    "- `Move`: A *move* is a set of positions to flip. A position will be an integer index into the coin sequence, so a move is a set of these such as `{0, 1}`, which we can interpret as \"flip the 12 o'clock (0) and 3 o'clock (1) positions.\" \n",
    "- `all_coins`: Set of all possible coin sequences: `{'HHHH', 'HHHT', ...}`.\n",
    "- `rotations`: The function `rotations(coins)` returns a list of all 4 rotations of the coin sequence.\n",
    "- `update`: The function `update(belief, move)` returns an updated belief state, representing all the possible coin sequences that could result from any devil rotation followed by the specified flip(s). (But don't flip `'HHHH'`, because the game would have already ended.)\n",
    "- `flip`: The function `flip(coins, move)` flips the specified positions within the coin sequence."
