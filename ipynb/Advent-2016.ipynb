    "\n",
    "From Dec. 1 to Dec. 25, [I](http://norvig.com) will be solving the puzzles that appear each day at **[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)**. The two-part puzzles are released at midnight EST (9:00PM PST); points are awarded to the first 100 people to solve the day's puzzles. The code shown here basically represents what I did to solve the problem, but slightly cleaned up:\n",
    "- On days when I start at 9:00PM and am competing against the clock, I take shortcuts. I use shorter names, because I'm not a fast typist. I run test cases in the Jupyter Notebook, but don't make them into `assert` statements. Even then, I'm not at all competitive with the fastest solvers.\n",
    "- On days when I didn't get a chance to start until after all the points are gone, what you see here is pretty much exactly what I did, or at least what I ended up with after correcting typos and other errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the problems completely, you will have to read the full description in the **\"[Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1):\"** link in each day's section header.\n",

    "# Day 0: Getting Ready\n",

    "On November 30th, I spent some time preparing: \n",
    "\n",
    "- I'll import my favorite modules and functions, so I don't have to do it each day.\n",
    "- From  looking at [last year's](http://adventofcode.com/2015) puzzles, I knew that there would be a data file on many days, so I defined the function `Input` to open the file.\n",
    "- I wanted a function `answer` to record the correct answer and its run time.\n",
    "- From working on another puzzle site, [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I had built up a collection of utility functions, shown below:"

    "This is tougher. I can't think of a simple `range` expression to describe who gets eliminated in a round. But I can represent the circle as a list and write a loop to eliminate elves one at a time. Again, if I did that with a `del` statement for each elf, it would be O(*N*<sup>2</sup>). But if instead I do one round at a time, replacing each eliminated elf with `None` in the list, and then filtering out the `None` values, then each round is only O(*N*), and since there will be log(*N*) rounds, the whole thing is only O(*N* log(*N*)). That should be reasonably fast.\n",

    "It is still tricky to know which elf to eliminate. If there are *N* elves, then the elf at position *i* should elminate the one at position *i* + *N* // 2. But we have to skip over the already-eliminated spaces; we can do that by keeping track of the number of eliminated elves in the variable `eliminated`. We also need to keep track of the current value of `N`, since it will change. And, since I don't want to deal with the headaches of wrapping around the circletconn, I will only deal with the first third of the elves: the first third all eliminate elves in the other two-thirds; if we went more than 1/3 of the way through, we would have to worry about wrapping around. (I had a bug here: at first I just iterated through `N // 3`. But when `N` is 2, that does no iteration at all, which is wrong; with two elves, the first should eliminate the other. It turns out it is safe to iterate through `ceil(N /3)` on each round.)\n",
