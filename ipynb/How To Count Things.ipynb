    "# How to Count Things\n",
    "\n",
    "Sesame Street teaches us to  count up to ten using our fingers. A computer doesn't have fingers, but it too can use brute force, enumerating things one by one, to easily count up to a billion or so. So in that sense, a billion is a small number. It is rare to get more than a billion <i>things</i> together in one place, but it is common to encounter situations where there many billions of <i>combinations</i> of things; indeed many problems have <a href=\"http://norvig.com/atoms.html\">more combinations of things than the number of atoms in the Universe</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for really big numbers we need a portfolio of counting strategies. Here is a partial list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brute Force enumeration**: Generate all the things, and count them one by one. <br>*Example*: How many odd numbers from 1 to 10? Answer: Generate {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, count 5.\n",
    "- **Enumerate and test**: Generate a larger set of candidate things, and count the ones that satisfy some criteria. <br>*Example*: How many odd prime numbers from 1 to 10? Answer: Generate {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, test each one for primality, count 3.\n",
    "- **Incremental enumeration**: When the things we are counting have parts, don't generate all possible complete things and then check each one to see if it is valid. Instead, generate the first part of a thing, and check if that part is valid so far. If it is, generate all the possibilities for the next part, but if it is not, stop there. That means that many invalid things will never get generated, saving time.<br>*Example*: Given a set of *n* cities, how many acyclic paths through some subset of cities are in alphabetical order by city name? Brute force enumeration would generate all permutations up to length *n* and check if each one was alphabetical; incremental enumeration would start generating paths and only extend them with cities in the correct order.\n",
    "- **Abstract enumeration**: put the things into equivalence classes, and calculate how many there are in each class. Then we don't have to enumerate all the things; we can consider many at the same time.\n",
    "- **Divide and conquer**: Split the problem into parts, solve each part, and combine the results.<br>*Example*: How many ways are there of getting a straight flush in poker? We can divide the problem into 4 subproblems, one for each suit. Then for each suit we can say: a straight can have one of 10 different high cards (5 through Ace), so there are 10 possible straights for each suit. The total number of straight flushes is 40, which you can think of either as multiplying 4 and 10, the numbers from the two independent components of the problem, or you can think of as adding 10+10+10+10 for the four disjoint parts of the problem.\n",
    "- **Recursive divide and conquer**: often we break a problem down into smaller pieces that are recursive instances of the same type of problem. We conquer by solving the smaller pieces and combining results.<br>*Example*: How many permutations are there of *n* things? If *n* > 0, solve by finding the number of permutations of *n* - 1 things, and multiplying by *n*.\n",
    "- **Formula calculation**: Use mathematical thinking to derive a formula for the number of things. <br>*Example*: How many odd numbers from 1 to *n*? The formula is ⌈n/2⌉, meaning \"divide *n* by 2 and round up\".\n",
    "- **Remembering**: Sometimes there are multiple ways to break a problem into subproblems, and when solving the big problem we may come across the same subproblem more than once. We can remember the solution to the subproblem so that we don't recompute it multiple times. We call that *memoizing* or *caching* the results; we can use the decorator `@lru_cache`.\n",
    "- **Simulation**: Sometimes it is difficult to exactly count all the things. But you can do a random simulation in which you record the things that randomly come up, and use those results as an estimate.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: When you're stuck, making a chart or table or plot of examples can help you see patterns that can lead to solutions.\n",
    "- **Checking**: make sure that your calculations work for small test cases that you verify by hand. Create two different programs and check that they agree with each other. A common approach is to have one straightforward but inefficient program that is easy to see is correct, and one program that is optimized for speed but more complex. If the two programs agree on the small inputs, you can have more confidence they are both correct.)\n",
    "- **Standing on shoulders**: it is fun to solve a problem on your own, but sometimes the right approach is to look up how others have solved it before. Sometimes you need to do some work to understand the problem better before you know how to search for a prior solution.<br>*Example*: In how many ways can a convex polygon be cut into triangles by connecting vertices? You could type the question directly as [a search](https://www.google.com/search?q=In+how+many+ways+can+a+convex+polygon+be+cut+into+triangles+by+connecting+vertices) and find some helpful answers. You could also solve the problem for small polygons (with *n* = 3 to 7 sides), note that the sequence of answers is [\"1, 2, 5, 14, 42\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=%221%2C+2%2C+5%2C+14%2C+42%22&oq=%221%2C+2%2C+5%2C+14%2C+42%22) and see that a search reveals that  these are called [Catalan Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number) and that there is a lot written about them.<br>*Example*: A coach wants to create a basketball lineup of three shooters and two rebounders. She has seven shooters and five rebounders to select from. How many different lineups can she make? Entering the text of the whole problem as a search query gives [results about basketball](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+coach+wants+to+create+a+basketball+lineup+of+three+shooters+and+two+rebounders.+She+has+seven+shooters+and+five+rebounders+to+select+from.+How+many+different+lineups+can+she+make%3F&oq=A+coach+wants+to+create+a+basketball+lineup+of+three+shooters+and+two+rebounders.+She+has+seven+shooters+and+five+rebounders+to+select+from.+How+many+different+lineups+can+she+make), not about combinatorics.  You need to understand the problem and standard terminology well enough to realize that a better query is [7 choose 3 * 5 choose 2](https://www.google.com/search?q=7+choose+3+*+5+choose+2).\n",

    "# Preliminaries: Imports and Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, here are the necessary imports, and four oft-used utility functions:\n",
    "- `quantify` (from [the `itertools` module recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)) takes a collection of things and a predicate and counts for how many things the predicate is true. It is designed for the **enumerate and test** strategy, but can be used for the **brute force enumeration** strategy by omitting the optional predicate (as long as none of the things you want to count are false (like `0` or the empty string).\n",
    "- `total` totals up all the values in a `dict` or `Counter`. Helpful because `sum(counter)` would sum the keys, not the values.\n",
    "- `iterate`: The pattern of repeatedly calling a function *n* times will be common in this notebook; `iterate(f, x, n)`, a function [borrowed](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:iterate) from  Haskell, encapsulates the pattern.\n",
    "- `same`: Tests if two functions return the same output for all the given inputs."

    "Here's how I think about a more efficient approach:\n",
    "* I can use **abstract incremental enumeration**: find a representation that summarizes all the barcodes of length zero, then incremently extend that summary to get a summary of the barcodes of length 1. Do that *n* times.\n",
    "* At each step, the key information that needs to be in the summary is how many barcode units of the same color are at the *end* of a barcode: if it is 1 or 2, then we can add another instance of the same color to the end. If it is 3, we cannot. We can always add the opposite color, and then the resulting barcode will end in just one unit of the same color. \n",
    "* Thus, the summary will be a list of four counts: `[e0, e1, e2, e3]`, where `ei` gives the number of strings that end in `i` units of the same color. \n",
    "* To take this summary and extend it by one unit to make the next summary:\n",
    "   - For all the counts except `e3` we could add a unit of the same color; that would show up in the next higher position (e.g. a count of 4 in `e1` would show up as a count of 4 in `e2` in the next summary).\n",
    "   - For all the counts, we could add a unit of the opposite color; the sum of them would show up in `e1` of the next summary.\n",
    "* The function `abstract_barcodes(n)` does this update `n` times (using `iterate`) and in the end takes the sum of the four counts in the summary.\n",
    "* With **brute force enumeration**, incrementing *n* by 1 doubles the amount of work (because you double the number of candidate strings). With **incremental enumeration** there are fewer strings, but still an exponential number of them.\n",
    "* With the **abstract incremental** approach, incrementing *n* by 1 does a constant amount of work. Thus the total complexity is *O*(*n*), instead of *O*(2<sup>*n*</sup>) for **brute force enumeration** and (we will see later) approximately *O*(1.8<sup>*n*</sup>) for **incremental enumeration**.\n",

    "> Students at a school must check in with the guidance counselor if they have three total absences, or three consecutive late days. Each student's attendance record consists of a string of 'A' for absent, 'L' for late, or 'P' for present.

How many attendance records of length *n* days are OK?\n",

The function `abstract_count_ok` implements this approach, again using `iterate`.\n",
    "* What is in the summary? A list of all `ok` records is too much. A simple count of the number of `ok` records is not enough. Instead, we need several different counts, for several different classes of records. Each class is defined by the number of `'A'` characters in the records, and the number of consecutive `'L'` characters at the *end* of the records, because these are the two things that determine whether the string will be `ok` or not `ok` when we add letters to the end).  So the summary can be represented as  a `Counter` of the form `{(A, L): count, ...}`. For example the summary `{(1, 2): 3, ...}` means that there are 3 `ok` records that contain one `'A'` and end in two `'L'`s. They records aren't explicitly named in the summary (that's why the summary can be efficient), but they would be `{'APLL', 'LALL', 'PALL'}`.\n",

    "* The function `extend_one_day` says that we can add an `'A'` to any string that doesn't already have two `'A'`s; we can add an `L` to any string that doesn't already end in 2 `'L'`s; and we can add a `'P'` to any string."

    "# Problem: Pirates Counting Coconuts\n",
    "\n",
    "The 538 Riddler poses [this problem](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pirates-monkeys-and-coconuts-oh-my) (slightly edited):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Seven pirates wash ashore on a deserted island. They gather coconuts into a central pile. As the sun sets, they all go to sleep.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">One pirate wakes up in the middle of the night. Being greedy, this pirate decides to take some coconuts from the pile and hide them for himself. As he approaches the pile, though, he notices a monkey watching him. To keep the monkey quiet, the pirate tosses it one coconut from the pile. He then divides the rest of the pile into seven equal bunches and hides one of the bunches in the bushes. Finally, he recombines the remaining coconuts into a single pile and goes back to sleep.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In succession, each of the pirates does the same routine. In the morning, the pirates split the pile into seven equal bunches and take one bunch each. (The monkey does not get one this time.)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">If there were *c* coconuts in the pile originally, what is the smallest possible value of *c*? What is *c* if there are *p* pirates?\n",
    "\n",
    "At least for *p* = 7, it seems like an **enumerate and test** approach should work, where we enumerate the number of coconuts, *c* and check if each amount can be evenly divided multiple times as the story dictates. The function `coconuts_divisible` does the check and `enumerate_coconuts` enumerates values of *c* and returns the first one that works. We can be somewhat clever in the enumeration: we know that the first pirate throws one coconut to the monkey and then the pile is divisible by *p*. So the only numbers we need to consider for *c* are of the form *kp* + 1, which we write in Python as `range(1, maxsize, p)`."

    "Let's first make sure we understand what counts as a valid rhyme scheme. Given a string, first task pick out the **first occurrences** of letters. For example, for the string `\"ABAB\"`, we read left-to-right, recording each time we see a letter for the first time; that gives us `\"AB\"`; the subsequent occurrences of `'A'` and `'B'` don't matter. Given `\"BAAB\"`, the first occurrences are `\"BA\"`. Now we have to decide if these first occurrences form a **prefix of the alphabet**,  `\"ABCD...\"`. For `\"AB\"` the answer is yes, but for `\"BA\"` the answer is no. \n",

One reason is **checking**: the two different approaches validate each other by giving the same answer. Another reason is that we can modify `count_paths` to handle things that are hard to do with just the formula. For example, what if we have a grid with some obstacles in it?  I'll define a `Grid` constructor, which adopts the convention that the input is a string of rows, where a `'.'` character within a row is a passable square, and all other (non-whitespace) characters are impassible barriers. Then `count_grid_paths` finds the number of paths on a grid from start to goal (by default, from upper left to lower right):"

    "Nicolas Schank proposes this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How many ways can you arrange the integers 1 through 2*n* in a 2 x *n* grid such that any two consecutive numbers are placed into squares that share a side?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of stating the problem is: how many paths are there that visit every square in  2 x *n* grid once,  moving from a square to any of its orthogonal neighbors. (The integers 1 is then the first square in the path, 2 the second, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **brute force enumeration** strategy would be to generate all (2*n*)! permutations of the integers and check if they form a valid path. That should work fine up to  *n* = 6, but not much beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I'll go to the  **incremental enumeration strategy**, in which I start with paths of length 1 and extend them one square at a time, checking for validity at each step, until we find all the paths that reach all 2*n* squares. (This is not an **abstract** strategy: these are individual paths, not summaries of them.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll describe a `Path` with three components, `Path(end, n, squares)`:\n",
    "  - `end`: the `(x, y)` coordinates of the square that the path ends in.\n",
    "  - `n`: the width of the grid. (This is the same for every path in a problem instance, but I had to store it somewhere.)\n",
    "  - `squares`: a dict of `{(x, y): i}` entries giving the order of the squares visited.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The approach then is that we start with one-square paths of the form `Path(s, n, {s: 1})` for every square `s` in the grid. Then we `iterate` calling `extend_paths` until we have all the complete paths. A path is extended by  placing the integer `len(squares) + 1` in any square that neighbors `path.end` and does not already appear in `path.squares`."

Next, place the other pieces in the 6 remaining squares, for 6! possibilities, but divide by 2! because the knights are indistinguishable, and divide by 3! because, out of the 3! ways of ordering R-K-R left-to-right, only 2 of them are valid, but the 2 cancels out because the rooks are indistinguishable."

    "- The `@lru_cache` decorator were not used on `count_change`.\n",
    "- We called `count_change(10**6)` instead of `count_change(10**5)`.\n",

    "- The order of the two recursive calls to `count_change` were reversed. \n",

    "I'll use the term **purse** for a collection of coins, because it is a [**bag**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) of coins. I'll implement `Purse` as a `Counter` of `{denomination: count}` pairs. (A purse is different than a mint: a mint just lists the denominations; a purse lists the denominations and how many coins we have of each denomination.) For example, `Purse({10: 2, 1: 4})` means two 10-cent coins and four 1-cent coins, for a total of 24 cents. I'll give the `Purse` class two methods to add or subtract one or more coins of the same denomination; these methods produce a new `Purse` and do not modify the old one."

    "- The function `meancoins(mint)` will give the mean number of coins required to make each amount of change from 0 to 99 cents.\n",
    "- The function `mincoins(amount, mint)` computes how many coins are needed for a given amount, or returns an absurdly large number (`maxsize`) if the amount cannot be made. (A mint that contains a `1` can make any amount.)\n",
    "- The variable `mints` holds a list of possible four-coin mints, such as `(27, 13, 3, 1)`.  I know that a 1 cent piece is required; otherwise I can't make an amount of 1 cent. That leaves 3 coins that could be anywhere from 2 to 99 cents; `mints` enumerate all the possible combinations."

(I won't allow the scenario where, say, I owe 24¢ and pay 25¢ and get 1¢ back.) Will some mints lead to accumulation of more coins than others? I'll do a random **simulation** to see:"

The cards look identical, and because you’re not one for record-keeping, you randomly pick one of the cards to pay with each time you get a drink. One day, the clerk tells you that the card you presented doesn’t have any drink credits left on it. How many free drinks can you expect are still available on the other card?\n",

But I can to use recursive **divide and conquer**:  I'll define `other_card(a, b)` to return a probability distribution of the number of drinks remaining on the \"other\" card, when we start with two cards with `a` and `b` drinks remaining, respectively, and we use them until one card is exhausted. At every step, the function considers decrementing both `a` and `b`, with equal probability (1/2 each). \n",

    "See [Wikipedia's matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) page for a refresher if needed, but we will explain everything here. A matrix is a two-dimensional grid of numbers. When we multiply two matrices, we do a lot of multiplications of the constituent numbers.  In the diagram below we see that multiplying a matrix of dimensions $l × m$ by a $m × n$ matrix results in a $l × n$ matrix, $C$, where each element $C_{ij}$ is the dot product of two $m$ element vectors, for a total of $l × m × n$ multiplications of constituent numbers. (Forget about [Strassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm) for now.)\n",

    "To multiply *three* matrices together, we could do either **(AB)C** or **A(BC)**; both give the same answer, but one might do fewer constituent multiplications. For a sequence of four matrices, there are five possible bracketings: **((AB)C)D,     (A(BC))D,     (AB)(CD),     A((BC)D)**, or     **A(B(CD))**. We want to find the bracketing with the fewest constituent multiplications.\n",

It turns out the answer is again the [Catalan numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number), so for 10 matrices there are only 4,862 possibilities; no problem. But for 25 matrices, there are 1,289,904,147,324 possibilities.\n",
