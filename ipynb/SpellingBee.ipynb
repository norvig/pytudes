    "The [Jan. 3 2020 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-the-vexing-vexillology/) concerns the popular NYTimes  [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) puzzle:\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this game, seven letters are arranged in a honeycomb lattice, with one letter in the center. Here’s the lattice from December 24, 2019:*\n",

    "*The goal is to identify as many words that meet the following criteria:*\n",
    "1. *The word must be at least four letters long.*\n",
    "2. *The word must include the central letter.*\n",
    "3. *The word cannot include any letter beyond the seven given letters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that letters can be repeated. For example, the words GAME and AMALGAM are both acceptable words. Four-letter words are worth 1 point each, while five-letter words are worth 5 points, six-letter words are worth 6 points, seven-letter words are worth 7 points, etc. Words that use all of the seven letters in the honeycomb are known as “pangrams” and earn 7 bonus points (in addition to the points for the length of the word). So in the above example, MEGAPLEX is worth 15 points.*\n",
    "\n",
    "***Which seven-letter honeycomb results in the highest possible game score?*** *To be a valid choice of seven letters, no letter can be repeated, it must not contain the letter S (that would be too easy) and there must be at least one pangram.*\n",

    "# Approach to a Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the referenced [word list](https://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt) was on my web site (it is a standard Scrabble word list that I happen to host a copy of), I felt somewhat compelled to submit an answer. I had worked on word puzzles before, like Scrabble and Boggle. My first thought is that this puzzle is rather different because it deals with *unordered sets* of letters, not *ordered permutations* of letters. That makes things much easier. When I tried to find the optimal 5×5 Boggle board, I couldn't exhaustively try all $26^{(5×5)} \\approx 10^{35}$ possibilites; I had to do hillclimbing to find a local maximum solution. But for Spelling Bee, it is feasible to try every possibility and get a guaranteed highest-scoring honeycomb. Here's a sketch of my approach:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Since order and repetition don't count, we can represent a word as a **set** of letters, which I will call a `letterset`. For simplicity I'll choose to implement that as a sorted string (not as a Python `set` or `frozenset`). For example:\n",
    "      letterset(\"GLAM\") == letterset(\"AMALGAM\") == \"AGLM\"\n",
    "- A word is a **pangram** if and only if its letterset has exactly 7 letters.\n",
    "- A honeycomb can be represented by a `(letterset, center)` pair, for example `('AEGLMPX', 'G')`.\n",
    "- Since the rules say every valid honeycomb must contain a pangram, it must be that case that every valid honeycomb *is* a pangram. That means I can find the highest-scoring honeycomb by considering all possible pangram lettersets and all possible centers for each pangram, computing the game score for each one, and taking the maximum.\n",
    "- So it all comes down to having an efficient-enough `game_score` function. We'll know how efficient it has to be once we figure out how many pangram lettersets there are (1,000? 100,000?). Note that it will be less than the number of pangrams, because, for example, the pangrams CACCIATORE and EROTICA both have the same letterset, ACEIORT."

    "3. The above calculations are independent of the honeycomb, so they only need to be done once, not 14,741 × 7  times. Nice saving!\n",
    "4. Now for each honeycomb, generate every valid **subset** of the letters in the honeycomb. A valid subset must include the center letter, and it may or may not include each of the other 6 letters, so there are exactly $2^6 = 64$ subsets. The function `letter_subsets(honeycomb)` returns these.\n",
    "5. To compute `game_score`, just take the sum of the 64 entries in the points table.\n",
