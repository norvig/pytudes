    "The [3 Jan. 2020 edition of the 538 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-the-vexing-vexillology/) concerns the popular NYTimes  [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) puzzle:\n",

    "> The goal is to identify as many words as possible that meet the following criteria:\n",
    "> 1. The word must be at least four letters long.\n",
    "> 2. The word must include the central letter.\n",
    "> 3. The word cannot include any letter beyond the seven given letters.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Note that letters can be repeated. For example, the words GAME and AMALGAM are both acceptable words. Four-letter words are worth 1 point each, while five-letter words are worth 5 points, six-letter words are worth 6 points, seven-letter words are worth 7 points, etc. Words that use all of the seven letters in the honeycomb are known as \"**pangrams**\" and earn 7 bonus points (in addition to the points for the length of the word). So in the above example, MEGAPLEX is worth 15 points.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Which seven-letter honeycomb results in the highest possible game score?*** To be a valid choice of seven letters, no letter can be repeated, it must not contain the letter S (that would be too easy) and there must be at least one pangram.\n",

    "4. `game_score2` (the name is changed because the interface has changed) takes a honeycomb and a points table as input. The idea is that every word that the honeycomb can make must have a letterset that is the same as a valid **letter subset** of the honeycomb. A valid letter subset must include the center letter, and it may or may not include each of the other 6 letters, so there are exactly $2^6 = 64$ valid letter subsets. (The function `letter_subsets(honeycomb)` computes these.)\n",
    "The result of `game_score2` is the sum of the honeycomb's 64 letter subset entries in the points table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that in `game_score2` we no longer need to iterate over 44,585 words and check if each word is a subset of the honeycomb. Instead we iterate over the 64 subsets of the honeycomb and for each one check&mdash;in one table lookup&mdash;whether it is a word (or more than word) and how many total points those word(s) score.  Since 64 &lt; 44,585, that's a nice optimization!\n",

This works because of a quirk of Python: we ask if `honeycomb.center in letters`; normally in Python the expression `x in y` means \"is `x` a member of the collection `y`\", but when `y` is a string it means \"is `x` a substring of `y`\", and the empty string is a substring of every string.
