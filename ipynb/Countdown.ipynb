I happen to remember that this is given by the [Catalan numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number), and we can [look it up](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9th+catalan+number) to find that there are 4862 diffferent bracketing. If we enumerated and evaluated all of them, it would take about 4862 times longer than doing a single `solve_no_brackets`, which took about 6 seconds, so the estimated time would be about 8 hours. I'm impatient, so I'd like a faster approach. \n",

    "# Counting Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex Bellos had another challenge:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> I was half hoping a computer scientist would let me know exactly how many solutions there are with only the four basic operations. Maybe someone will. \n",
    "\n",
    "As it stands, my program can't answer that question, because I only keep one expression for each value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I'm not sure what it means to be a distinct solution. For example, are `((10+9)+8)` and `(10+(9+8))` different, or are they same, because they both are equivalent to `(10+9+8)`? Similarly, are `((3-2)-1)` and `(3-(2+1)` different, or the same because they both are equivalent to `(3 + -2 + -1)`? I think the notion of \"distinct solution\" is just inherently ambiguous, and each of these questions could reasonably be answered either way. My choice is to count each of these as distinct: every expression has exactly ten numbers, nine operators, and nine pairs of brackets, and if an expression differs in any character, it is different. But I won't argue with anyone who prefers a different definition of \"distinct solution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can I count expressions? One approach would be to go back to enumerating every equation (all 4862 &times; 4<sup>9</sup> = 1.2 bilion of them) and checking which ones equal 2016. That would take about 40 hours with my Python program, but I could get it under 40 minutes in a more efficient language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to count subexpressions as the table is filled in. We won't enumerate all the expressions, just count them. I'll introduce a second table, `COUNTS`, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "    COUNTS[(10, 9, 8)][27] == 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "because there are 2 ways to make 27 with the numbers `(10, 9, 8)`, namely, `((10+9)+8)` and `(10+(9+8))`.\n",
    "How do we compute the counts? By looking at every split and operator choice that can make the value, and summing up (over all of these) the product of the counts for the two sides.  For example, there are 2 ways to make 27 with `(10 ... 8)`, and it turns out there are 3526 ways to make 1 with `(7 ... 1)`. So there are 2 &times; 3526 = 7052 ways to make 28 with this split by adding 27 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll make `expr` maintain `COUNTS` as well as `EXPS`. And I'll define  `clear` to clear out the cache of `COUNTS` and `EXPS`, so that we can fill the tables with our new, improved entries."

    "# Exponentiation, and Four 4s\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's turn to another of Alex's puzzles: making 2016 and other target values from a string of four or five `4`s,  with exponentiation allowed. Exponentiation is tricky for five reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Division by zero**: `(0 ^ -1)` is the same as `(1 / 0)`, and gives a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "- **Irrationals**: `(3 ^ (1 / 2))` is an irrational number; so we can't do exact rational arithmetic.\n",
    "- **Imaginaries**: `(-1 ^ (1 / 2))` is an imaginary number, but Python gives a `ValueError`.\n",
    "- **Overflow**: `(10. ^ (9. ^ 8.))`, as a `float`, gives a `OverflowError`.\n",
    "- **Finite memory**: [`(10 ^ (9 ^ (8 * 7)))`](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+%5E+9+%5E+56), as an `int`, gives an `OutOfMemoryError` (even if your memory uses every atom on Earth).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we deal with this? We can't do exact rational arithmetic. We could try to do exact *algebra*, perhaps using [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), but that seems difficult\n",
    "and computationally expensive, so instead I will abandon the goal of exact computation, and do everything in the domain of floats (reluctantly accepting that there will be some round-off errors). We'll coerce numbers to floats when we first put them in the table, and all subsequent operations will be with floats. I define a new function, `expr2`,  to call `expr`, catching arithmetic errors. Since we are making some rather arbitrary decisions about what expressions are allowed (e.g. imaginary numbers are not), I'll give up on trying to maintain `COUNTS`."
