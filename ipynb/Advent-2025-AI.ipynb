    "# Advent of Code 2025: The AI LLM Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook shows some solutions by Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT, three AI Large Language Models (LLMs),  for the 2025 [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) programming puzzles. In order to understand each puzzle, you'll have to look at the problem descriptions at [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2025) for each [**Day**](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1), and you can also look at [**my solutions**](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/main/ipynb/Advent-2025.ipynb), which I did before asking the LLMs for theirs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*All the code in this notebook is written by an LLM (except for the one line where I call the LLM's code for each puzzle). My comments (like this one) are in italics, and my prompts given to the LLMs are in **bold italics**. Sometimes I quote the LLM's responses; those are in* regular roman font.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Each day I'll choose a model and give it the prompt* \"***Write code to solve the following problem:***\" *followed by the full text of the AoC Part 1 problem description. Then I'll prompt again with* \"***There is a change to the specification:***\" *followed by the AoC Part 2 description.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now that the 12 days are finished, here are my conclusions:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Overall, the LLMs did **very well**, producing code that gives the correct answer to every puzzle.*\n",
    "- *I'm beginning to think I should use an LLM as an assistant for all my coding, not just as an experiment like this.*\n",
    "- *This is a huge improvement over just one year ago, when LLMs could not perform anywhere near this level.*\n",
    "- *The three LLMS seemed to be roughly equal in quality.*\n",
    "- *I neglected to track the time it took them to produce the code, but it was a lot faster than me–maybe 20 times faster.*\n",
    "- *The LLMs knew the things you would want an experienced software engineer to know:*\n",
    "    - *How to see through the story about elves and christmas trees, etc. and get to the real programming issues*\n",
    "    - *Standard Python syntax, builtin types, and basic modules (e.g. `collections`, `functools`, `typing`, `numpy`)*\n",
    "    - *using the `re` module and/or `str.split` to parse input, even when it is in a somewhat tricky format*\n",
    "    - *modular arithmetic*\n",
    "    - *memoization / caching / dynamic programming*\n",
    "    - *O*(*n*) *reasoning (such as knowing that enumerating up to √n is better than up to n)*\n",
    "    - *stacks and queues*\n",
    "    - *sorting and merging*\n",
    "    - *when to use sets versus lists*\n",
    "    - *handling a 2D grid of points with 4 or 8 directional neighbors*\n",
    "    - *accumulating sums in a defaultdict or Counter*\n",
    "    - *advanced esoteric data structures such as Union-Find and dancing links*\n",
    "    - *computational geometry algorithms including scan lines, flood fill, and ray-casting*\n",
    "    - *recognizing an integer linear programming problem and knowing how to call a package*\n",
    "    - *depth-first search, meet-in-the-middle search, and recognizing search properties such as commutativity of actions*\n",
    "    - *data classes*\n",
    "    - *sometimes type annotations (on about 1/3 of the solutions)*\n",
    "    - *sometimes good doc strings and comments (but not always, and sometimes too many comments).*\n",
    "- *Problems 9.2 and 12.1 had a \"trick\" that allowed for a simpler, faster solution. For these I gave ChatGPT my input file, so it would have a chance of finding the trick. It didn't, but perhaps it was trying to solve the general problem over all possible inputs, whereas I understood that if AoC persents a trick input to me, they will present the same trick input to everyone.*\n",
    "- *Much of the code (from all 3 LLMs) could be improved stylistically.  In many cases the code was one long function that has the parsing of input, the intermediate processing, and the return of the final result all intertwined, clearly violating Robert Maartin's maxim of \"Functions should do one thing.\"*\n",
    "- *The run time were reasonably fast, all under half a second. However, this was about 3 times slower than my code. (I'm not counting 12.1, which had a run time of about 2 minutes, but missed the \"trick\" that no search is actually required. It would be unfair to compare it to my code, which ran much faster, but would fail if a search was required.)*\n",
    "- *The LLMs' code is about five times more verbose than mine. There are a few reasons:*\n",
    "    - *I benefited from a few key utility functions to do things like \"return a tuple of all the integers in a text string.\" For most problems I could parse the input in 1 or 2 lines of code, while the LLM would take 20.*\n",
    "    - *The LLMs were being extra robust in doing error checking, while I recognized that within the confines of an AoC puzzle the input will always follow the prescribed format exactly.*\n",
    "    - *I use a functional style; the LLMs were imperative. So I did `sum(int(max_joltage(bank)) for bank in banks)` whereas ChatGPT did:*\n",
    "\n",
    "          total = 0\n",
    "          for line in input_text.strip().splitlines():\n",
    "              line = line.strip()\n",
    "              if not line:\n",
    "                  continue\n",
    "              total += max_joltage_for_bank(line)\n",
    "          return total\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** *For brevity, I have removed some of the LLM output, such as:*\n",
    "- *Usage examples on how to run the program on the test input*.\n",
    "- *Prose analysis of the problem, descriptions of the programs, and chain of thought thinking.*\n",
    "  - *In most cases these were accurate and thorough! Great job! But they were too long to include here.*\n",
    "- *The \"`#!/usr/bin/env python3`\" and \"`__main__`\" idioms for command line execution.*\n",
    "  - *In retrospect, I should have specified in the prompt that \"**You can get the input text as a single string with get_text(day)\"***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Day 0: Human\n",
    "\n",
    "*On Day 0 I load my [**AdventUtils.ipynb**](AdventUtils.ipynb)  so I can access two of my utilities:*\n",
    "- *`get_text(day)` returns the complete text of the input file for `current_year` and `day`*\n",
    "- *`answer` verifies whether the LLM got the right answer to the problem, and records the run time.*"

    "*where this is what I wrote for 7.2. Here is Gemini's reply:*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great comparison. Your code is much more concise and \"Pythonic,\" using collections.Counter and in-place updates to reduce verbosity. It strips away a lot of the boilerplate  that my solution included for robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your Code**: Assumes 'S' is always on the first line (manifold[0]). If 'S' is buried in the middle of the grid, your code crashes or misses it.\n",
    "- **My Code**: Scans the whole grid for 'S', which handles cases where the entry point isn't at the very top.\n",
    "- **Your Code**: Relies on Python's robust dictionary handling to avoid index errors (if b-1 is negative, it just adds a key to the dict). This is clever, but effectively allows particles to wrap around or exist in \"negative space\" if not careful (though typically harmless for this specific puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "***My rebuttal**: To me, the instructions make it clear that the  'S' must be on the top line. (If there is no 'S' on the top line, my code will return 0, not crash.) Similarly, the puzzle implies that beams can't go outside the borders, but Gemini is right that if the input file **did** have a splitter in the first or last column then there could be a problem that I don't check for.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Next I asked Gemini: **Do you think your code could be improved with some more modularity/abstraction, such as having a separate function to get input?** It replied:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, absolutely. Breaking the code down makes it much easier to read, test, and debug. If the input format changes (e.g., reading from a file vs. a raw string) or the simulation rules change (e.g., different splitter types), you only have to modify one specific function.\n",

ChatGPT didn't detect the shortcut and wrote code to rotate the shapes and search through possible placements. ChatGPT did have the check for `total_area > W * H`, so it is able to instantly reject the regions with too many presents (about half of them). But for the regions where there is a trivial fit into 3x3 squares, ChatGPT's code still tries to pack them in tightly rather than doing the simple layout.* "
