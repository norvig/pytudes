    "- **Your Code**: Relies on Python's robust dictionary handling to avoid index errors (if b-1 is negative, it just adds a key to the dict). This is clever, but effectively allows particles to wrap around or exist in \"negative space\" if not careful (though typically harmless for this specific puzzle input).\n",

(If there is no 'S' on the top line, my code will return 0, not crash.) Similarly, the puzzle implies that beams can't go outside the borders, but Gemini is right that if the input file did have a splitter in the first or last column then there could be a problem that I don't check for.*\n",
