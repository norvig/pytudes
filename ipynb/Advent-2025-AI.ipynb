    "Each day I'll choose a model and give it the prompt \"*Write code to solve the following problem:*\" followed by the full text of the AoC Part 1 problem description. Then I'll prompt again with \"*There is a change to the specification:*\" followed by the AoC Part 2 description. So far the LLMs are doing quite well. \n",

    "For brevity, I have removed some of the models' output, such as:\n",

    "- The \"__main__\"` idiom for running code from the command line\n",
    "- Test examples to run.\n",

    "Overall, the models did well, producing code that gives the correct answer in a reasonable run time. Some of the cosde could be improved stylistically.  (But I guess if you're vibe coding and not looking at the code, maybe that doesn't matter.)\n",
