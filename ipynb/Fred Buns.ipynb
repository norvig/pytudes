    "The [June 15, 2015 post](http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2015/06/lets-get-this-show-on-road-once-we-all.html) on *Bike Snob NYC* leads with \"*Let's talk about bike locks.*\" Here's what I want to talk about: in my local bike shop, I saw a combination  lock called *WordLock&reg;*,\n",
    "which replaces digits  with  letters.   I classified this as a Fred lock,\n",
    "\"[Fred](http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-fred-too-far.html)\" being the term for an amateurish cyclist with inappropriate equipment.\n",
    "I tried the combination \"FRED,\" and was amused with the result:\n",
    "![](http://norvig.com/ipython/fredbuns.jpg)\n",
    "FRED BUNS! Naturally I set all the other locks on the rack to FRED BUNS as well. But my curiosity was raised ... \n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many words can the WordLock&reg; make?\n",
    "3. Can a lock with different letters on the tumblers make more words? \n",
    "4. How many words can be made simultaneously? For example, with the tumbler set to \"FRED\", the lock\n",
    "above also makes \"BUNS\" in the next line, but with \"SOMN\", fails to make a word in the third line.\n",
    "Could different letters make words in every horizontal line?\n",
    "5. Is it a coincidence that the phrase \"FRED BUNS\" appears, or was it planted there by mischievous WordLock&reg; designers? \n",
    "\n",
    "# Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can answer the questions, we'll need to be clear about the vocabulary of the problem and how to represent concepts in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lock**: For our purposes a lock can be modeled as a `list` of 4 **tumblers**. \n",
    "* **Tumbler:** Each tumbler has  10 distinct letters. I will represent a tumbler as a `str` of 10 letters.\n",
    "* **Combination**: Choosing a letter from each tumbler gives a combination, such as \"FRED\" or \"BUNS\". There are 4<sup>10</sup> = 10,000 combinations.\n",
    "* **Word**: Some combinations (such as \"BUNS\") are *words*; others (such as \"SOMN\") are not words. We'll need a collection of dictionary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now on to the code!  First the imports I will need and the vocabulary concepts:"

    "So 31/50 locks got a score of 1240.\n",
    "My first reaction to this was that if I discovered  31 different locks with score 1240, then probably there is at least one undiscovered lock with a score above 1240. But a discussion with [Matt Chisholm](https://blog.glyphobet.net/faq) changed my thinking. The key is to realize that some locks that look different are actually the same; they just have the letters in a different order. I define the function `alock` to put each tumbler into alphabetical order (and make the lock be a tuple rather than a list, so that it can be an entry in a `dict` or `set`):"

    "There is still one unanswered question: did the designers of WordLock&reg; deliberately put  \"FRED BUNS\" in, or was it a coincidence? Hacker News reader [emhart](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=emhart) (aka the competitive lockpicker Schyler Towne) astutely commented that he had found the [patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US6621405) assigned to WordLock; it describes an algorithm similar to my `greedy_lock`.\n",
    "After seeing that, I'm inclined to believe that \"FRED BUNS\" is the coincidental result of running the algorithm. On\n",
    "the other hand, there is a [followup patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US20080053167) that discusses a refinement\n",
    "\"wherein the letters on the wheels are configured to spell a first word displayed on a first row of letters and a second word displayed on a second row of letters.\" So the possibility of a two-word phrase was something that Wordlock LLc. was aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see below that the procedure described in the [patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US6621405) is not quite as good as `greedy_lock`, because the patent states that at each tumbler position \"*the entire word list is scanned*\" to produce the letter frequencies, whereas `greedy_lock` scans only the words that are consistent with the previous tumblers. Because of that difference, `greedy_lock` produces more words, 1177 to 1161:"
