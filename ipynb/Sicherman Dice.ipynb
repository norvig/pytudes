    "Ali: Huh. [**This**](http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/dice-3) is interesting.  You know how, in a board game like Monopoly, you roll two dice, add them up, and then move that number of spaces? \n",

    "Ali: The interesting thing is that people have been playing dice games for 7,000 years. But it wasn't until 1977 that <a href=\"http://userpages.monmouth.com/~colonel/\">Colonel George Sicherman</a> asked whether is is possible to have a pair of dice that are not \"standard\" dice (standard dice have [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] on their six sides) but have the same **distribution of sums** as a standard pair–so the pair of Sicherman dice would also have one way of making a 2 and four ways of making 9, but it could be different ways; maybe 8+1 could be one way. Like standard dice, each of the sides on a Sicherman die is a positive integer, but some of them could be greater than 6.\n",

We know the other die can only have one 1, so it must have some sides that are greater than 1, so the pair would make some sums that are greater than 12. That's wrong, so that means the assumption must be wrong: it can't be true that a  die has an 11.**\n",
