    "[**Wordle**](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is Josh Wardle's [tremendously popular](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) word game in which a **guesser** tries to guess a secret **target** word (chosen from a **word list** of allowable words) in as few guesses as possible. Each guess must be one of the words on the list, and the **reply** to each guess consists of 5 bits (actually [trits](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trit#English)) of information, one for each of the 5 word spots:\n",
    "  - *Green* if the guess letter is in the word and in the correct spot.\n",
    "  - *Yellow* if the guess letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.\n",
    "  - *Miss* if the letter is not in the word in any spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wordle uses a list of 12,971 allowable guess words, but only 2,309 of them can be target words. (I think the idea is to follow [Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle): \"be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept\".) In this notebook, we'll assume we're only dealing with the 2,309 target words. Historically, Wordle is a refinement of **Jotto**, and has in turn inspired variants inclusding **Evil Wordle** and **Antiwordle**, all of which we will cover in this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "The rules for Wordle replies, outlined above, contain an ambiguity. Let's clear things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the guess is `'NINNY'` and the target is `'ANNEX'`. A strict reading of the rules would say that the reply should be `'Y.GY.'`–one of the three `'N'`s is in the right spot and thus is green, and the other two should be yellow  because they are  \"in the word but in the wrong spot.\" But the actual (unstated) rules are that Wordle matches the greens first, and then goes left-to-right with the yellows, and only gives you as many non-misses as there are letters in the target to support them. In this example, there are two `'N'`s in the target, so after the one green, there will only be one more yellow `'N'`, and it will be in the leftmost available spot. The actual reply is `'Y.G..'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, how many possible replies are there? There are 3 responses at each of five positions, and  3<sup>5</sup> = 243, but five of those replies are impossible: you can't have four Greens and one Yellow, because if four letters of the guess are in the right place then the fifth must be either in the right place or a miss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the definition of `reply_for` and some tests. Note that `reply_for` is not symmetric; `reply_for(A, B)` is always a permutation of `reply_for(B, A)`, but they are usually not equal. Since the computation of a reply is somewhat complex, we cache the results.\n"

    "# Consistent Target Words\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concept in Wordle is the idea of **consistent target words**. If I guess `'NINNY'` and the reply is `'Y.G..'`, then the target word could be `'ANNEX'`, but it could also be `'ANNUL'` or `'CANON'`. We say these three words are **consistent** with the guess/reply pair.  If we next guess `'ENNUI'` and get the reply `'YGG..'`, then `'ANNEX'` is the only consistent target. When there is a single consistent target left, the guesser can always get it on the next guess. In general, given a word list, I can always determine the list of consistent targets from a sequence of guess/reply pairs. Once I know the consistent words, the guess/reply pairs themselves provide no additional useful information.  "

Ideally, we want the partition that minimizes the average number of additional guesses it will take to finish the game (and possibly also that minimizes the number of times that we more than 6 guesses). However, just looking at a single partition (without looking ahead further) can't tell us what we want to know, so instead we can minimize one of the following proxy metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum**: choose the partition that minimizes the size of the largest branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expectation**: In probability theory, the expectation (also known as expected value) is the weighted average of a random variable. Here it means the sum, over all branches, of the probability of ending up in the branch multiplied by the size of the branch. We are assuming that every target is equally likely, so the probability of a branch is proportional to the number of targets in it.\n",

    "- **Negative Entropy**: In information theory, entropy is the weighted average amount of \"information\" measured in bits. The calculation is the same as expectation except that we count the base 2 logarithm of the branch sizes, not the branches sizes themselves.

Every time you guess, I look at all possible 5-letter words that would fit all your guesses, and choose the match pattern [reply] that results in the most possible words. My goal is to maximize the amount of guesses it takes to find the word.\"*\n",

If the Evil Replier did look-ahead, perhaps they could get to one of those branches. But we know that the Evil Replier greedily picks the branch with the \"most possible words.\" So I will define `evil` to follow branches through a guess tree and produce the (guess, reply) pairs along the way. For a given tree, there is only one possible game (assuming the Evil Replier breaks ties the same way each time)."

    "# Jotto\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto) is a venerable word game (invented in 1955) that is quite similar to Wordle. The difference is that the reply in Jotto is an integer from 0 to 5 giving the number of matching letters, with no indication of which letter(s) are correct nor whether they are in the right position or not. There are several variants of Jotto; here are four key questions and my answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many letters can each word have? **Five**.\n",
    "- Does a guess have to be a word in the word list? **Yes.**\n",
    "- Can a word have repeated letters, like the \"E\" in \"ELECT\"? **No. Every word must have 5 distinct letters.**\n",
    "- What if the reply is \"5\", but the guess is not the target? **Not allowed.**<br>*(E.g., only one of the anagrams APERS/PARES/PARSE/PEARS/REAPS/SPARE/SPEAR  is allowed in the word list.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a Jotto word list by:\n",
    "- Starting with a list of words. (We'll use the Wordle word list.)\n",
    "- Discarding the ones that don't have 5 distinct letters.\n",
    "- Putting the rest into a dict of anagrams keyed by the set of letters.\n",
    "- Keeping only one word for each anagram."

    "There are many directions you could take this if you are interested:\n",
    "- **Other games:**\n",
    "  - Implement [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29). The default version has 6 colors and 4 pegs. Can you go beyond that?\n",
    "  - Consider a Jotto game variant where each reply consists of two numbers: the number of letters in common with the target, and the number of letters that are in the exact correct position, as in Mastermind.\n",
    "  - Research what other computer scientists have done with [Jotto](https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.3342) or [Mastermind](http://serkangur.freeservers.com/).\n",
    "  - There are many variants of Wordle: Evil Wordle, Anti-Wordle, Quordle, Octordle, ...\n",
    "  - Refactor the code so it can more smoothly handle multiple different games.\n",
    "- **Better strategy**:\n",
    "  - Our `minimizing_tree` function is **greedy** in that it guesses the word that minimizes some metric of the current situation without looking ahead to future branches in the tree. Can you get better performance by doing some **look-ahead**? Perhaps with a beam search?\n",
    "  - As an alternative to look-ahead, can you improve a tree by editing it? Given a tree, look for interior nodes that end up with a worse-than-expected average score, and see if the node can be replaced with something better (covering the same target words). Correcting a few bad nodes might be faster than carefully searching for good nodes in the first place.\n",
    "  - The three metrics (max, expectation, and negative entropy) are all designed as proxies to what we really want to minimize: the average number of guesses. Can we estimate that directly? For example, we know a branch of size 1 will always take 1 guess; a branch of size 2 an average of 3/2 guesses; and a branch of size 3 an average of 5/3 guesses if one of the words partitions the other two, otherwise an average of 2. Can we learn a function that takes a set of words as input and estimates the average number of guesses for the set? Would a deep neural net be a good way to learn this function?\n",
    "  - Is it feasible to do a complete search and find the guaranteed optimal strategy? What optimizations to the code would be necessary? Is it worthwhile to port to a different language? How long would the search take?\n",
    "  - We assume that the list of taregt words is known to the guesser. The [New York Times WordleBot](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/upshot/wordle-bot.html) initally took this approach too, but then switched to a more nuanced approach where the guesser (the Bot) does not know for sure the list of target words, but instead assigns words a probability of being a target word that is correlated with the word's frequency in English usage. Can you develop a guesser that works along these lines?\n",
    "- **Chooser strategy**:\n",
    "  - Analyze the game where the chooser is not random, but rather is an adversary to the guesser–the chooser tries to choose a word that will maximize the guesser's score. What's a good strategy for the chooser? Is there a strategy equilibrium?\n",
    "  - Refactor `play` to accomodate three roles:\n",
    "    - A chooser, who decides what the target word is.\n",
    "    - A guesser, who guesses the target word.\n",
    "    - A replier, who says what the reply to the guess is."
