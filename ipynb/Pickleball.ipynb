    "# Scheduling a Doubles Pickleball Tournament\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend Steve asked for help in creating a schedule for a round-robin doubles pickleball tournament with 8 or 9 players on 2 courts. (*To clarify:* [Pickleball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball) is a paddle/ball/net game played on a court that is smaller than tennis. In this type of tournament a player plays with a different partner in each game.) \n",
    "\n",
    "> Given *P* players and *C* available courts, create a **schedule**: a list of **rounds** of play, where each round consists of from 1 to *C* **games** played simultaneously. Each game pits one **pair** of players against another pair. The **criteria** for a schedule are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Each player should partner *with* each other player once (or as close to that as possible).\n",
    "2. Each player should play *against* each other player twice (or as close to that as possible).\n",
    "3. Each court should be filled each round (or as close to that as possible); in other words, fewer rounds are better.\n",
    "4. A player *cannot* be scheduled to play twice in the same round.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's a schedule for *P*=8 players on *C*=2 courts. It says that in the first round, players 4 and 6 partner against 2 and 3 on one court, while 5 and 7 partner against 0 and 1 on the other court.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Round  1: | 4,6 vs 2,3 | 5,7 vs 0,1 |\n",
    "    Round  2: | 0,2 vs 1,3 | 4,5 vs 6,7 |\n",
    "    Round  3: | 5,6 vs 0,3 | 1,2 vs 4,7 |\n",
    "    Round  4: | 0,4 vs 3,6 | 2,7 vs 1,5 |\n",
    "    Round  5: | 0,5 vs 1,4 | 2,6 vs 3,7 |\n",
    "    Round  6: | 0,6 vs 2,5 | 1,7 vs 3,4 |\n",
    "    Round  7: | 3,5 vs 1,6 | 2,4 vs 0,7 |\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is a pretty good schedule&mdash;it is optimal according to criteria 1, 3, and 4, but it is not optimal in terms of who plays against who; for example players 1 and 5 play 3 times, not 2. We will see if we can do better. Our overall strategy is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To satisfy criterion 1, we will start with a list of all pairs of players. The function `all_pairs` does this.\n",
    "- We will then call `make_games` to take these pairs and put them together into a list of games, strictly enforcing criterion 4 that a player can't be scheduled into both sides of the net in any one game.\n",
    "- Next we call `schedule` to take the list of games and put them into a schedule with up to *C* games played at the same time. We will again strictly enforce criterion 4, not allowing a player to appear on two courts at the same time.\n",
    "- If this approach does not result in everybody playing everyone else twice we will randomly pick two games, and swap one sode of the net in one game with one side of the net in the other game, and check if that is an improvement.\n",
    "\n",

This is called a **hillclimbing** approach; the analogy is that we start out in a valley, take a step in a random direction, and if that is upward, keep going, otherwise step back and try again. Eventually you reach a peak. \n",

If the swap makes things worse, discard it; if it makes things better, keep it. Either way, try `N` swaps. I measure \"better\" both in terms of the variation from the optimal distribution of opponents (as measured by `opp_difference(games, pairs)`) and in terms of the number of rounds (as measured by `len(sched)`).
