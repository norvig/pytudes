    "Last month I demonstrated [a simple Regex Golf program](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb?create=1). I thought that was the end of the topic, but [Stefan Pochmann](http://www.stefan-pochmann.info/spocc/) sent me a series of emails suggesting some impressive improvements. ([Davide Canton](https://plus.sandbox.google.com/108324296451294887432/posts) and [Thomas Breuel](https://plus.google.com/118190679520611168174/posts) also had good suggestions.) So this post is an exploration of some of Stefan's new ideas, and some of my own. It's a story about regex golf, and about using exploratory programming to test out ideas.\n",

    "To review, here's the program from [part 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb?create=1), with some minor modifications:"

    "What does this say?  First the table says that there are only three regexes that have 4 winners; all the rest have 3 or fewer winners.  So the links going left-to-right are rather sparse.  There are more links going the other direction; 110 to `van-buren`, for example.  The histograms give the whole picture mapping set sizes to the number of keys that have that set size.  So, on the left we see that over 1400 regexes have a set size of one winner, and 100 or fewer have set sizes of 2 and 3, and we saw that only 3 regexes have a set size of 4 winners.  On the right, the histogram shows a wide spread of winners that have set sizes between 1 and 110 regexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "From looking at this I get two ideas:\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ I notice that both `'oo..'` and `'oo.'` happen to match 3 winners. But even if I didn't know how many they matched, I would know that the winners matched by `'oo..'` must be a subset of the winners matched by `'oo.'` (remember that a set is a subset of itself). Furthermore, `'oo.'` is shorter.  This suggests that we would *never* want to use  `'oo..'` in a solution, because we could always make the solution one character shorter (and cover at least all the same winners) by substituting `'oo.'`.  We say that * part A dominates B* if *A* is shorter and matches a superset of winners. We might as well throw out all dominated parts right at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It might be a good idea to pay special attention to the characters, like `'-'`, that appear in the winners but not the losers.\n",
    "\n",

Think about it: on each recursive call, `exhaustive_search` selects the best part, and then calls itself recursively with `best` chosen as part of the partial solution.  It keeps going until it reaches a complete solution.  That's exactly what greedy search does. But then exhaustive search does more:  It also considers all the cases where it *didn't* choose the best part.\n",

If there are *P* parts, then there are $2^P$ subsets of parts. Now, we don't have to consider every one of these subsets, because the search ends when we cover all the winners.  If there are $W$ winners, than an upper bound on the number of combinations we have to consider is the number of ways we can pick $W$ parts from a pool of $P$, which in math we write as  ($P$ choose $W$).  For the presidential candidates  $W$, is 34, and $P$ is 1615.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The *branch* part of the name means that, just like exhaustive search, on each iteration it picks a part, and considers two branches, one where the part is in the solution, and one where it is not.  \n",
    "- The *bound* part of the name means that the algorithm continually keeps track of the lowest-cost solution it has found so far.  This serves as a *bound* on what the optimal solution can be.\n",
    "- The *trick* is to notice that the cost of a partial solution always *increases* as we add more parts to it.  Therefore, if we ever get to a partial solution whose cost is more than the lowest-cost solution we have found so far, then we can *immediately* discard the partial solution, and *never consider* all the other combinations that would have come from continuing the partial solution. If there are $MP$ parts left to consider, that means we just eliminated $2^P$ potential combinations all at once. \"Eliminating potential combinations\" is also called \"pruning the search tree\"&mdash;\"[pruning](https://www.google.com/search?q=pruning)\" means cutting off unwanted branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode below uses a global variable called `CHEAPEST` to hold the lowest-cost solution found so far.  Note that the two branches (two recursive calls in lines 7 and 8) communicate through this global variable.  If the first branch sets `CHEAPEST` to an improved solution, then the second branch will see it.  That is why it is important to choose good \"best\" parts&mdash;it means we are more likely to find a good solution early on, which makes it more likely that we can prune away branches.  "

    "We defined the notion of a regex being *dominated* if there is some other regex that is shorter (or at least not longer) and covers a superset of winners. How can we efficiently compute which parts are dominated? Here's one simple approach: go through each regex part, `p`, and every time we find one that is not dominated by any another regex part `p2`, add `p` (and its winners) to a new dict that we are building up.  This approach works, but it is $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an alternative that is faster: First, sort all the regexes so that the ones that match more winners come first (in case of tie, put the shorter ones first).  (In other words, \"best\" first.)   Initialize a new dict to empty, and go through the sorted regexes, `p`, one at a time.  For each `p`, compare it only to the regexes, `p2`, that we have already added to the new dict; if none of them dominate `p`, then add `p`. This is still $O(n^2)$, but if, say, 99 out of 100 regexes are eliminated, we will only need $n^2/100$ comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for `eliminate_dominated` is a slight variant on the [version](https://github.com/pochmann/regex-golf) by Stefan Pochmann (because his version turned out to be better than my first version). Note that the function `signature` represents a regex as a pair of numbers, the negative of the number of winners and the length in characters.  The smaller (in lexicographical order) this pair is, the \"better\" the regex is.  Why is it important to put the regexes in sorted order?  So that we know that the only possible dominators are the ones that came *before*, not ones that come after. Note that, as we are going through the component regexes, `p`, in sorted order, if we ever hit a `p` that covers no winners, then we know that all the remaining `p` will also cover no winners (because we're going in best-first order), so we can break out of the loop immediately. And one more thing: the expression `covers[p2] >= covers[p]` asks if `p2` covers a superset of the winners that `p` covers."

    "We're making good progress. What next? We now have so many parts, that many of the searches do not complete. Suppose one of our first choices was wrong, and the search took a part that does not belong in an optimal solution.  We might well spend all our calls on the half of the search tree that keeps the part, never exploring a part of the tree without it.  I'd like to alter the search algorithm to get us out of that rut.\n",

    "# Searching: Random Restart\n",

    "One way out of the rut is to run the search for a while, then stop it, and run a different search, that explores a different part of the search space. This is called a *random restart search*. How do we get a *different* search when we restart? I can think of two easy things to vary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ The '4' in the `score` function. That is, vary the tradeoff between number of winners matched and number of characters in a regex.\n",
    "+ The tie-breaker. In case of a tie on `max(covers, key=score)`, Python always picks the first component. Let's make it choose a different one each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is easy; we can use the `random.choice` function to choose an integer, K, to serve as the tradeoff factor. The second is easy too. We could write an alternative to the `max` function, say `max_random_tiebreaker`. That would work, but an easier approach is to build the tiebreaker into the `score` function. In addition to awarding points for matching winners, and subtracting a point for each character in the solution, we will have `score` add in a random number. We'll call this the \"fuzz factor\" and use the variable `F` to determine how big it is.  If the fuzz factor is a random number between 0 and 1, then all it does is serve as a tiebreaker.  But if it is a random number that can be larger than 1, then sometimes it will cause `max` to pick a best part that does not have quite the best score.  We're not sure how much randomness is best, so we'll let the values of `K` and `F` vary from one choice to the next."

    "# Speculating: Other Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to stop here, but I'll briefly mention some other ideas that I didn't get to investigate.  Perhaps you can play with some of these, or with other ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Completely different approach*: [Thomas Breuel](https://plus.google.com/118190679520611168174/posts) suggested doing [minimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization) of [weighted finite state transducers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/nlpa.iupr.com/resources/nlpa-openfst.ipynb?attredirects=0&create=1).\n",
    "- *Character classes*: We never considered character classes, such as `'[abc]'`. It is not obvious they would help, but it is possible.  Consider the fragment `'ld|la'`, which shows up in one of the solutions.  We could replace that with a single component, `'l[da]'`.  But we haven't gained anything; both are 5 characters long.  If we had had `'l.d|l.c|l.b|l.a'` then the replacement `'l.[a-d]'` would save 8 characters, but I don't see many opportunities like that.  It might also be possible to use *negative* character classes, like `l[^y]` to explicitly avoid something in the losers set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Prefilter parts*: Currently, `regex_covers` generates a huge set of components, then eliminates the ones that match losers (or don't match winners), and then eliminates the ones that are dominated.  We could make `regex_covers` faster by not generating components that can't possibly contribute.  Suppose we're considering a subpart, say `'ab'`. If it matches no losers, then there is no reason to extend it to a longer subpart, such as `'abc'`, because we know that `'abc'` is dominated by `'ab'`.  By filtering out dominated parts before we have to check them, I estimate we should be able to cut the time for `regex_covers` in half, maybe better.\n",
    "- *Better component choice*: We pick the \"best\" component based on how many winners it covers and how many characters it takes.  Maybe we could have a better measure; perhaps taking into account whether it covers winners that are \"easy\" to cover by other regexes, or \"hard\" to cover.\n",
    "- *Tuning*: We have the two parameters `K` and `F`, which are randomly chosen from a fairly arbitrary distribution.  We could measure which values of the parameters perform better and pick those values more often.\n",
    "- *Post-editing*: We concentrated on the task of generating a solution from scratch; another task is to improve an existing solution.  For example, take the set of components in a solution, and see if one component could be dropped&mdash;it is possible that all the winners covered by that component might accidentally have been covered by other components, making it unnecessary. Or take all pairs of components, and see if they could be replaced by a shorter set of components.\n",
    "- *Better bounds*: Branch and Bound search works best if the bounds are tight.  If we can recognize early that the path we are on cannot possibly be as good as the best solution found so far then we can cut off search early and save time.  But the bound estimate we are using now is a poor one.  We estimate the cost of a solution as the cost of the partial solution plus the cost of the shortest component remaining.  We use this estimate because all we know for sure is that we need at least one more component.  Here's one way to get a better bound by recognizing that in many cases we will need more than one more component. We'll define the following quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    + *P* = the length of the partial solution, plus the \"|\", if needed.  So if the partial solution is `None`, then *P* = 0, else *P* is the length plus 1.\n",
    "    + *S* = the length of the shortest regex component in `covers`.\n",
    "    + *W* = the number of winners still in `covers`.\n",
    "    + *C* = the largest number of winners covered by any regex in `covers`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The current estimate is *P* + *S*.  We can see that a better estimate is *P* + *S* &times; ceil(*W* / *C*).\n",
    "\n",
