Sicherman assumes that each side bears a positive integer.\n",

The technical term for a collection where order doesn't matter but where you can have repeated elements is a **bag**, or sometimes called a [**multiset**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset). For example, the regular pair of dice makes two 11s with 5+6 and 6+5, and another pair could make two 11s with 7+4 and 3+8.  Can you think of a representation that will do that?\n",
