    "We see there are 27 relevant outcomes, of which 13 are green. So 13/27 really does seem to be the right answer. This picture also gives us a way to think about why the answer is not 1/3. Think of the yellow-plus-green area as a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, with an overlap. Each stripe is half yellow and half green, so if there were no overlap at all, the probability of green would be 1/2.  When each stripe takes up half the sample space and the overlap is maximal, the probability is 1/3. And in the Problem 3 table, where the overlap is small, the probability is close to 1/2 (but slightly smaller).\n",

First, if you want to convince me, show me a sample space; don't just make philosophical arguments. (Although a philosophical argument can be employed to help you define the right sample space.) Second, while I agree that before she goes to sleep, Beauty's *unconditional* probability for heads should be 1/2, I would say that both before she goes to sleep and when she is awakened, her *conditional* probability of heads *given that she is being interviewed* should be 1/3, as shown by the sample space."

But don't feel bad if you got this one wrong; it turns out that Monty Hall himself, who opened many doors while hosting *Let's Make a Deal* for 13 years, didn't know the answer either, as revealed in this letter from Monty to Prof. Lawrence Denenberg, when Denenberg asked for permission to use the problem in his textbook:\n",

    "Daniel Bernoulli came up with a second response to the paradox based on the idea that if you have a lot of money, then additional money becomes less valuable to you. If I had nothing, and I won \\$1000, I would be very happy. But if I already had a million dollars and I won \\$1000, it would be less valuable. How much less valuable? Bernoulli proposed, and [experiments confirm](https://books.google.com/books?id=1oEa-BiARWUC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=mr+beard+oil+wildcatter+value+of+money+utility&source=bl&ots=cBDIX-rkTz&sig=GHB8-inorWrU39vA8JYV_sCtqB8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI5fu-p8qlyAIViKWICh0XAAz5#v=onepage&q=mr%20beard%20oil%20wildcatter%20value%20of%20money%20utility&f=false), that *the value of money is roughly logarithmic.* That is, rational bettors don't try to maximize their expected monetary value, they try to maximize their *expected utility*: the amount of \"happiness\" that the money is worth.\n",
    "I'll write the function `util` to describe what a dollar amount is worth to a hypothetical gambler. `util` says that a dollar is worth a dollar, until the amount is \"enough\" money. After that point, each additional dollar is worth half as much (only brings half as much happiness). Value keeps accumulating at this rate until we reach the next threshold of \"enough,\" when the utility of additional dollars is halfed again. The exact details of `util` are not critical; what matters is that overall money becomes less valuable after we have won a lot of it."

The paradox is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 33 red balls and 66 other balls that are either black or yellow. You don't know the mix of black and yellow, just that they total 66. A single ball is drawn at random. You are given a choice between these two gambles:\n",
    "- **R**: Win \\$100 for a red ball.\n",
    "- **B**: Win \\$100 for a black ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You are also given a choice between these two gambles:\n",
    "- **RY**: Win \\$100 for a red or yellow ball.\n",
    "- **BY**: Win \\$100 for a black or yellow ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people reason as follows: \n",
    "- **R**: I win 1/3 of the time\n",
    "- **B**: I win somewhere between 0 and 2/3 of the time, but I'm not sure of the probability. \n",
    "- **RY**: I win at least 1/3 of the time and maybe up to 100% of the time; I'm not sure. \n",
    "- **BY**: I win 2/3 of the time. \n",
    "- Overall, I prefer the relative certainty of **R** over **B** and of **BY** over **RY**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paradox is that, from an expected utility point of view, that reasoning is inconsistent, no matter what the mix of black and yellow balls is (or no matter what you believe the mix might be).  **RY** and **BY** are just the same gambles as **R** and **B**, but with an additional \\$100 for a yellow ball. So if you prefer **R** over **B**, you should prefer **RY** over **BY** (and if you prefer **B** over **R** you should prefer **BY** over **RY**), for any possible mix of black and yellow balls.\n",

    "Overall, **B** is more successful, 83% to 78%, even though **A** is better in both cases. So if you had kidney stones, and you want the highest chance of success, which treatment would you prefer? If you knew you had small stones (or large stones), the evidence supports **A**. But if the size was unknown, does that mean you should prefer **B**? Analysts agree that the answer is no, you should stick with **A**. The only reason why **B** has a higher overall success rate is that doctors choose to do **B** more often on the easier, small stone cases, and reserve **A** for the harder, large stone cases. **B** is better, but it has a lower overall percentage because it is given the difficult patients.\n",

For the batting average data, we trust the overall numbers, because there are no such biases, and because larger numbers lead to a closer approximation to a true value. The data alone can't tell you what to believe; you need the story (and the model) behind the data as well."

Just be explicit about what the problem says, and then methodical about defining the sample space, and finally be careful in counting the number of outcomes in the numerator and denominator.  But the bigger lesson is: treat those around you as reasonable people, and when they have different opinions, try to discover what problem they are  solving.\n",
