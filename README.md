# pytudes

"An *Ã©tude* (a French word meaning *study*) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)

This project contains **pytudes**&mdash;Python programs for perfecting programming skills.

# Etudes for Programmers

I got the idea for the "etudes" part of the name from 
this [1978 book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Etudes_for_programmers.html?id=u89WAAAAMAAJ) 
by [Charles Wetherell](http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/08/25/interview-with-charles-wetherell/)
that was very influential to me when I was first learning to program.
